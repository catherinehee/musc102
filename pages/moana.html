            <h2>Overview: The Shift to "Consultative Appropriation"</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Moana</em> (2016) represents Disney's response to decades of criticism about cultural representation. 
                The studio partnered with the Oceanic Cultural Trust and Polynesian composer Opetaia Foa'i, marking a 
                visible shift from outright exclusion to formalized collaboration. However, this case study reveals how 
                collaboration can serve to extract cultural legitimacy while maintaining Western structural control.
            </p>

            <h2>The Oceanic Cultural Trust: A New Model?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Disney established the Oceanic Cultural Trust (OCT), bringing together anthropologists, linguists, 
                choreographers, and cultural practitioners from across the Pacific. On the surface, this represents 
                meaningful progress — Indigenous voices were invited into the creative process.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>What Changed in Phase II</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Formalized collaboration with cultural consultants</li>
                    <li>Indigenous musicians involved in composition</li>
                    <li>Use of Pacific languages in the soundtrack</li>
                    <li>Visual accuracy in cultural details</li>
                    <li>Marketing emphasized "authenticity"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                However, as scholar Michelle Anya Anjirbag argues, this methodology reveals <strong>"embedded coloniality"</strong> 
                — where inclusion strategies serve to insulate the corporation from critique while preserving Western 
                decision-making power.

            <h2>"We Know The Way": Contained Authenticity</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubZrAmRxy_M" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                Although Polynesian musician Opetaia Foa'i contributed distinct rhythms and lyrics, Western composers 
                Lin-Manuel Miranda and Mark Mancina retained ultimate creative authority. Ethnomusicological analysis 
                uncovers that <strong>Polynesian elements are systematically "wrapped" within Western musical tropes</strong>. 
                Namely, the songs' starts and ends utilize Western orchestration and harmonic structures to frame its 
                Polynesian sounds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even "We Know the Way" (Miranda, Foa'i, and Mancina), featuring Foa'i's compositions, adheres to Western 
                pop verse-chorus structures and is performed by Miranda. This "wrapping" signals to global audiences that 
                <strong>Indigenous elements are acceptable only when contained within recognizable American conventions</strong>. 
                Polynesian musical contributions provide an additional flair of culture without disrupting the Western musical 
                foundation.

            <h2>"How Far I'll Go": The Universal (Western) Core</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubZrAmRxy_M" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film's emotional centerpiece, "How Far I'll Go," is a standard Broadway power ballad composed by 
                Lin-Manuel Miranda. While Moana is Polynesian, her "I want" song — the moment of deepest emotional 
                revelation — is musically indistinguishable from any contemporary Disney princess song.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>The Pattern Continues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cultural specificity = atmosphere and setting</li>
                    <li>Western conventions = emotional depth and character development</li>
                    <li>The "universal" is defined by Western musical structures</li>
                    <li>Non-Western music positioned as "ethnic flavor," not narrative core</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This structural choice communicates ideology: authentic Polynesian music is welcome when it provides 
                cultural texture, but Western musical language remains necessary for "universal" emotional resonance.

            <h2>"Revise It for English Ears": The Limits of Collaboration</h2>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    In an interview, Foa'i notes how Disney <strong>instructed him to revise his compositions for 
                    "English ears,"</strong> which further highlights how marketability was prioritized over authenticity.
                </p>
                <cite>— Madeleine Chapman, "Moana Composer Opetaia Foa'i on Keeping Disney's Moana Authentic through Music" (2017)</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                This single detail reveals everything about the power dynamics of Phase II collaboration. Foa'i was 
                invited to the table — but Disney <em>instructed</em> (not asked) him to modify his work for commercial 
                viability. "English ears" becomes code for Western market expectations overriding cultural authenticity.
            </p>

            <p>
                As Rebecca Armstrong argues, <strong>the advisory process extracts legitimacy rather than relinquishing 
                actual creative authority</strong>. It exemplifies commodity racism: the corporation adopts a collaborative 
                image only to placate its audiences, while preserving the decision-making power. Disney gains protection 
                from criticism ("We worked with Polynesian consultants!") while maintaining final control over the product.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Commodity Racism in Action</h2>
            
            <p>
                bell hooks describes "commodity racism" as a process where ethnicity functions as "spice, seasoning 
                that can liven up the dull dish that is mainstream white culture." <em>Moana</em> exemplifies this 
                dynamic perfectly:
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>How Moana Commodifies Polynesian Culture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Polynesian elements provide "authentic" flavor and marketability</li>
                    <li>Western structures organize and commercialize that authenticity</li>
                    <li>Indigenous collaborators give legitimacy to Western-controlled product</li>
                    <li>Profits flow to Western corporation, not Pacific communities</li>
                    <li>Cultural specificity subordinated to "universal" (Western) appeal</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film appeals to Disney's increasingly diverse audiences and placates past critiques, while 
                preserving the corporation's decision-making power. This is <strong>hegemony disguised as diversity</strong>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Economic Imperative</h2>
            
            <p>
                Why doesn't Disney simply allow Polynesian composers full creative authority? The answer is economic: 
                executives operate under the assumption that Western musical conventions constitute a "universal" 
                emotional language, while non-Western structures represent financial risk.
            </p>

            <p>
                This assumption is never tested — instead, it functions as self-fulfilling prophecy. Audiences are 
                conditioned to accept Western structures as neutral and universal through repeated exposure, while 
                non-Western music remains coded as "ethnic" and "specific."
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What This Teaches Audiences</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Moana</em> functions as a pedagogical tool, teaching global audiences — including Polynesian children — 
                that while cultures may differ visually and linguistically, "real" emotion must be expressed through 
                Western musical forms. This promotes cultural homogenization where non-Western sounds serve as 
                atmospheric decoration for Western narratives.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">

                    "The films function as pedagogical tools that train audiences—including those from the represented 
                    cultures—to perceive Western aesthetics as 'natural' and their own traditional forms as 'exotic.'"

        <section>
            <h2>Progress or Adaptation?</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Moana</em> represents undeniable improvements over <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Pocahontas</em>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Genuine cultural consultation</li>
                <li>Indigenous language inclusion</li>
                <li>Polynesian musical contributions</li>
                <li>Visual and cultural accuracy</li>
                <li>Positive representation benefits</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                However, these improvements occur <em>within an unchanged power structure</em>. The corporation has 
                adapted its methods to the era of identity politics by inviting "Others" into the room — but it has 
                not handed over the baton. Western composers retain final authority, non-Western elements serve 
                Western frameworks, and profits remain centralized.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is not decolonization. It is sophisticated colonialism.
