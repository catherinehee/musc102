            <h2>Overview: The Shift to "Consultative Appropriation"</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Moana</em> (2016) represents Disney's response to decades of criticism about cultural representation. 
                The studio partnered with the Oceanic Cultural Trust and Polynesian composer Opetaia Foa'i, marking a 
                visible shift from outright exclusion to formalized collaboration. However, this case study reveals how 
                collaboration can serve to extract cultural legitimacy while maintaining Western structural control.

            <h2>The Oceanic Cultural Trust: A New Model?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Disney positioned Moana (2016) as a triumph of faithful representation. Following research trips to Pacific 
                Islands, directors John Musker and Ron Clements established the Oceanic Cultural Trust, an advisory body 
                comprising experts from Pacific Island nations ("How the Oceanic Cultural Trust"). For instance, the film incorporated Polynesian languages in 
                the soundtrack and featured specific elements drawn from extensive collaboration. Disney's marketing extensively 
                highlighted this  process, positioning the project as a culturally responsible effort.

            <p>
                Despite this, musical production demonstrates the limits to this collaboration. However, as scholar Michelle 
                Anya Anjirbag argues, this methodology reveals <strong>"embedded coloniality"</strong> — where inclusion 
                strategies serve to insulate the corporation from critique while preserving Western decision-making power (Anjirbag, 2018).

            <h2>"We Know The Way"</h2>

            <p>
                Although Polynesian musician Opetaia Foa'i contributed distinct rhythms and lyrics, Western composers 
                Lin-Manuel Miranda and Mark Mancina retained ultimate creative authority. Ethnomusicological analysis 
                uncovers that <strong>Polynesian elements are systematically "wrapped" within Western musical tropes</strong> (Armstrong, 2018). 
                Namely, the songs' starts and ends utilize Western orchestration and harmonic structures to frame its 
                Polynesian sounds.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even "We Know the Way" (Miranda, Foa'i, and Mancina, 2016), featuring Foa'i's compositions, adheres to Western 
                pop verse-chorus structures and is performed by Miranda (Armstrong, 2018). This "wrapping" signals to global audiences that 
                <strong>Indigenous elements are acceptable only when contained within recognizable American conventions</strong>. 
                Polynesian musical contributions provide an additional flair of authenticity without disrupting 
                the Western musical foundation.
            </p>

            <p>
                In an interview, Foa'i notes how Disney <strong>instructed him to revise his compositions for 
                "English ears,"</strong> which further highlights how marketability was prioritized over authenticity (Chapman, 2017).
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>The advisory process extracts legitimacy rather than relinquishing 
                actual creative authority</strong>. It exemplifies commodity racism: the corporation adopts a collaborative 
                image only to placate its audiences, while preserving the decision-making power.
