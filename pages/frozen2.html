            <h2>Overview: Negotiating Power Differentials</h2>
            <p>
                Following criticism of the original <em>Frozen</em> (2013) for its superficial use of generalized 
                Scandinavian motifs, Disney implemented a formalized collaborative model for <em>Frozen II</em> (2019). 
                The corporation partnered with <em>verddet</em>, an advisory group comprising Sámi artists, elders, and 
                cultural experts. This case reveals the limits of collaboration when creative authority remains 
                non-negotiable.

            <h2>The Criticism of Frozen (2013)</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                The original <em>Frozen</em> utilized a generic "frozen north" aesthetic without meaningful engagement 
                with Sámi culture, despite the story's setting in a Nordic-inspired kingdom. While the film featured 
                Frode Fjellheim's joik-inspired "Vuelie" in the opening, this was largely decorative, and Sámi 
                communities criticized the lack of genuine representation.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Problems with Frozen (2013)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generic Nordic fantasy aesthetic</li>
                    <li>No meaningful Sámi consultation</li>
                    <li>Joik used decoratively without cultural context</li>
                    <li>Sámi-inspired Kristoff as minor, comedic character</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This criticism prompted Disney to adopt a more collaborative approach for the sequel — but the question 
                remains whether this collaboration represented genuine power-sharing or managed inclusion.

            <h2>Verddet: The Advisory Model</h2>
            
            <p>
                For <em>Frozen II</em>, Disney partnered with <em>verddet</em>, which included Sámi artists, reindeer 
                herders, historians, and cultural practitioners. This collaboration successfully improved visual 
                accuracy — Sámi clothing designs (<em>gákti</em>), reindeer practices, and cultural details were 
                respectfully rendered.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>However, the musical soundscape remained firmly under Western authority.</strong> While visual 
                consultants had meaningful input, sonic decisions were subject to negotiation, modification, and 
                ultimately, erasure.

            <h2>Kulning vs. Joik: A Revealing Substitution</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIOyB9ZXn8s" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film also substitutes <strong>kulning</strong> (non-Sámi Scandinavian cattle call) for 
                <strong>joik</strong> in the mysterious voice calling Elsa, despite their distinct ethnic roots. 
                Kulning aligns with Western expectations of "magical" Nordic fantasy; joik might sound too unfamiliar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Kulning was chosen because it fit Western audience expectations of what "Nordic magic" sounds like — 
                ethereal, haunting, and familiar from other fantasy media. Joik, meanwhile, has specific cultural and 
                spiritual meanings that don't conform to generic fantasy aesthetics. Thus, although Sámi traditions 
                enrich the film's texture, <strong>they do not define its sonic identity. Disney only includes elements 
                when they do not disrupt the established Disney aesthetic.</strong>

            <h2>"Vuelie": From Exotic Atmosphere to Decontextualized Ritual</h2>
            
            <p>
                Conversely, the musical soundscape, under the direction of Western composer Christophe Beck, remains 
                subject to erasure of Indigenous specificity. "Vuelie," the franchise's iconic opening chant composed 
                by Sámi musician Frode Fjellheim, mixes the "chant-like" joik, the traditional Sámi vocal form, with 
                classical vocal style co-written with Beck. Originally, Frozen (2013) featured "Vuelie" without 
                acknowledging its origins, using it solely to score the film's exotic atmosphere. The composition was 
                used for its "memorably melodic opening tune," not its cultural significance as a Sámi chant.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Frozen II (2019) attempted to rectify this by featuring the song in a ritual welcoming Elsa and Anna 
                into the Northuldra community, mimicking the Sámi tradition of joiking for acceptance into society. 
                Yet the performance still relied on the non-Sámi Cantus choir rather than Sámi voices, perpetuating 
                what scholars term "slippage between 'Sámi' and 'Scandinavian'" and recontextualizing the ritual into 
                background music. The scene provides no explanation of the ritual's cultural meaning, trivializing it 
                into background music instead.
            </p>

            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L9L2VvObQXM" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                Lead composer Beck also mischaracterizes "Vuelie" as "Hey Na Na music" and refers to joiking as a 
                "Northern European yodel" and "Scandinavian element," obscuring its Indigenous Sámi roots in favor of 
                vague geographic markers that erase cultural specificity. This failure by a key creative figure to 
                correctly identify cultural tradition directly undermines Disney's public claims of respectful cultural 
                stewardship.
