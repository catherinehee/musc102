            <h2>Overview: Negotiating Power Differentials</h2>
            <p>
                Following criticism of the original <em>Frozen</em> (2013) for its superficial use of generalized 
                Scandinavian motifs, Disney implemented a formalized collaborative model for <em>Frozen II</em> (2019). 
                The corporation partnered with <em>verddet</em>, an advisory group comprising Sámi artists, elders, and 
                cultural experts. This case reveals the limits of collaboration when creative authority remains 
                non-negotiable.

            <h2>The Criticism of Frozen (2013)</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moSFlvxnbgk" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The original <em>Frozen</em> utilized a generic "frozen north" aesthetic without meaningful engagement 
                with Sámi culture, despite the story's setting in a Nordic-inspired kingdom. While the film featured 
                Frode Fjellheim's joik-inspired "Vuelie" in the opening, this was largely decorative, and Sámi 
                communities criticized the lack of genuine representation.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Problems with Frozen (2013)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generic Nordic fantasy aesthetic</li>
                    <li>No meaningful Sámi consultation</li>
                    <li>Joik used decoratively without cultural context</li>
                    <li>Sámi-inspired Kristoff as minor, comedic character</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This criticism prompted Disney to adopt a more collaborative approach for the sequel — but the question 
                remains whether this collaboration represented genuine power-sharing or managed inclusion.
            </p>

            <h2>Verddet: The Advisory Model</h2>
            
            <p>
                For <em>Frozen II</em>, Disney partnered with <em>verddet</em>, which included Sámi artists, reindeer 
                herders, historians, and cultural practitioners. This collaboration successfully improved visual 
                accuracy — Sámi clothing designs (<em>gákti</em>), reindeer practices, and cultural details were 
                respectfully rendered.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>However, the musical soundscape remained firmly under Western authority.</strong> While visual 
                consultants had meaningful input, sonic decisions were subject to negotiation, modification, and 
                ultimately, erasure.

            <h2>Kulning vs. Joik: A Revealing Substitution</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIOyB9ZXn8s" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film's central mystery revolves around a mystical voice calling to Elsa. This voice uses 
                <strong>kulning</strong> — a Scandinavian cattle-calling technique — rather than <strong>joik</strong>, 
                the traditional Sámi form of vocalization.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Joik</strong> is culturally specific to the Sámi people</li>
                    <li><strong>Kulning</strong> is a broader Nordic/Scandinavian practice</li>
                    <li>The story explicitly engages with Sámi-inspired Northuldra people</li>
                    <li>Kulning aligns with Western expectations of "magical" Nordic fantasy</li>
                    <li>Substitution reflects commercial over ethnomusicological priorities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Kulning was chosen because it fit Western audience expectations of what "Nordic magic" sounds like. 
                It's ethereal, haunting, and familiar from other fantasy media. Joik, meanwhile, has specific cultural 
                and spiritual meanings that don't conform to generic fantasy aesthetics.
            </p>

            <h2>"Hey Na Na Music": Eurocentric Dismissal</h2>
            
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    Composer Christophe Beck dismissed joik as "Hey Na Na music," reflecting a Eurocentric refusal 
                    to engage with the complexity of Indigenous musical traditions.
                </p>
                <cite>— Mihaela Mihailova, "Negotiable Diversity" (2025)</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                This quote reveals everything about Phase II's limitations. Beck's dismissive characterization reduces 
                a sophisticated Indigenous vocal tradition to nonsense syllables. This is not ignorance — it's a 
                refusal to engage with musical complexity that doesn't conform to Western expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Joik is not simple "Hey Na Na" vocalizations. It's a deeply sophisticated practice where each joik 
                is uniquely composed for a specific person, place, or animal, evoking essence rather than describing. 
                It operates on fundamentally different principles than Western melody-based composition.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beck's dismissal demonstrates that even in Phase II's "collaborative" model, Indigenous musical 
                traditions can be rejected if they don't fit established Disney aesthetics.

            <h2>"Vuelie": Decontextualized Authenticity</h2>
            
            <p>
                When authentic Sámi music does appear — such as Frode Fjellheim's joik-based composition "Vuelie" 
                in the opening sequence — it is decontextualized from its spiritual and cultural origins, abstracted 
                into a generic fantasy atmosphere.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "Sámi culture enriches the film's texture but does not define its sonic identity. Its elements 
                    are only included as long as it does not disrupt the established Disney aesthetic and hinder 
                    maximum commercial appeal."
                </p>
                <cite>— Analysis of Frozen II's cultural negotiation</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                The presence of Sámi musical elements serves to provide authenticity and protect Disney from criticism, 
                but these elements function as seasoning, not substance. The core musical language remains firmly Western.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Visual Success, Sonic Subordination</h2>
            
            <p>
                The contrast between visual and sonic representation is instructive. <em>Verddet</em> consultants had 
                meaningful input on visual elements, resulting in respectful representation of Sámi material culture. 
                However, music — the medium that communicates emotion and drives narrative — remained non-negotiable.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>The Pattern of Selective Collaboration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual:</strong> Accurate gákti designs, reindeer practices, living patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Linguistic:</strong> Consultation on cultural concepts and terminology</li>
                    <li><strong>Musical:</strong> Western control maintained; Indigenous forms rejected or decorative</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This hierarchy reveals what Disney considers negotiable versus essential. Visual accuracy can be 
                achieved without threatening commercial viability, but sonic identity — the emotional core — must 
                remain Western to ensure market success.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>The Broadway Default</h2>
            
            <p>
                Like <em>Moana</em>, <em>Frozen II</em>'s emotional centerpiece songs — "Into the Unknown," "Show Yourself" 
                — are standard Broadway power ballads composed by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. While Elsa's 
                journey involves Sámi-inspired Indigenous people and their cultural knowledge, her emotional expression 
                remains musically indistinguishable from any Western musical theater production.
            </p>

            <p>
                The message is clear: Sámi culture can provide visual atmosphere and narrative conflict, but Western 
                musical language structures "universal" emotional truth.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Improved Yet Unchanged</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Frozen II</em> represents meaningful progress in many ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Formalized collaboration with Indigenous advisory board</li>
                <li>Respectful visual representation of Sámi culture</li>
                <li>Engagement with colonial history (dam narrative)</li>
                <li>Positive representation for Sámi communities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                However, these improvements coexist with persistent structural control. The collaboration model allows 
                Disney to market authenticity while retaining final authority over creative decisions. When Indigenous 
                musical traditions conflict with commercial imperatives or aesthetic expectations, they are rejected, 
                modified, or relegated to decorative roles.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>This is not partnership — it is managed consultation designed to extract legitimacy while 
                preserving power.</strong>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Genuine Collaboration Would Look Like</h2>
            
            <p>
                True decolonization of cultural representation would require:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sámi composers with final authority over musical decisions</li>
                <li>Centering Indigenous musical structures for emotional core, not just atmosphere</li>
                <li>Rejecting the assumption that Western conventions equal "universal" appeal</li>
                <li>Profit-sharing with represented communities</li>
                <li>Creative control, not just consultative input</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Until these conditions are met, even the most well-intentioned collaboration serves to modernize 
                cultural hegemony rather than dismantle it.
