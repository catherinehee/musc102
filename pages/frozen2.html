            <h2>Overview: Negotiating Power Differentials</h2>
            <p>
                Following criticism of the original <em>Frozen</em> (2013) for its superficial use of generalized 
                Scandinavian motifs, Disney implemented a formalized collaborative model for <em>Frozen II</em> (2019). 
                They formed the <em>verddet</em>, an advisory group comprising Sámi artists, elders, and 
                cultural experts. This case reveals the limits of collaboration when creative authority remains 
                non-negotiable.

            <h2><em>Verddet</em>: The Advisory Model</h2>
            
            <p>
                For <em>Frozen II</em>, Disney partnered with <em>verddet</em>, which included Sámi artists, reindeer 
                herders, historians, and cultural practitioners (Arctic Council, 2020). This collaboration successfully improved visual 
                accuracy from the generic "frozen north" aesthetic: Sámi clothing designs (<em>gákti</em>), reindeer practices, and other cultural details were 
                respectfully rendered (Mihailova, 2025).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>However, the musical soundscape remained firmly under Western authority.</strong> While visual 
                consultants had meaningful input, sonic decisions were subject to negotiation, modification, and 
                ultimately, erasure.

            <h2>"Vuelie": From Exotic Atmosphere to Decontextualized Ritual</h2>
            
            <p>
                "Vuelie," the franchise's iconic opening chant, was composed by Sámi musician Frode Fjellheim in collaboration with film composer Christophe Beck. The piece mixes joik, the traditional Sámi vocal form, with classical vocal style. Originally, <em>Frozen</em> (2013) featured "Vuelie" for its "memorably melodic opening tune," not its cultural significance as a Sámi chant (Mihailova, 2025).
            </p>

            <div class="video-container">

            </div>

            <p>
                <em>Frozen II</em> (2019) attempted to rectify this by featuring the song in a ritual welcoming Elsa and Anna 
                into the Northuldra community, mimicking the Sámi tradition of joiking for acceptance into society. 
                Yet the performance still relied on the non-Sámi Cantus choir rather than Sámi voices, perpetuating 
                what scholars term "slippage between 'Sámi' and 'Scandinavian'" and recontextualizing the ritual into background music rather than explaining its cultural significance (Mihailova, 2025).  

            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Lead composer Beck also mischaracterizes "Vuelie" as "Hey Na Na music" and refers to joiking as a 
                "Northern European yodel" and "Scandinavian element," obscuring its Indigenous Sámi roots in favor of 
                vague geographic markers that erase cultural specificity (Mihailova, 2025). This failure by a key creative figure to 
                correctly identify cultural tradition directly undermines Disney's public claims of respectful cultural 
                stewardship.

            <h2>Kulning vs. Joik: A Revealing Substitution</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRT8_m8aoow?si=Ptler_uriHenRYna" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film also substitutes <strong>kulning</strong> (non-Sámi Scandinavian cattle call) for 
                <strong>joik</strong> in the mysterious voice calling Elsa, despite their distinct ethnic roots. 
                Kulning aligns with Western expectations of "magical" Nordic fantasy; joik was deemed too unfamiliar.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Kulning</em> was chosen to cater to Western audience expectations of what "Nordic magic" sounds like. <em>Joik</em>, meanwhile, has specific cultural and 
                spiritual meanings that don't conform to generic fantasy aesthetics (Fuller, 2020). Thus, although Sámi traditions 
                enrich the film's texture, <strong>they do not define its sonic identity. Disney only includes elements 
                when they do not disrupt the established Disney aesthetic.</strong>
