            <h2>Overview: The Foundation of Disney's "Othering"</h2>
            <p>
                The history of Disney's non-Western musical representation is rooted in earlier, overt displays of 
                caricature, exemplified by the 1953 film <em>Peter Pan</em>. This film employed a foundational 
                colonial mechanism that predates Phase I, relying on crude, generalized sonic markers and amalgamation 
                to signal exoticism. The song "What Made the Red Man Red?" explicitly reinforced racist discourse, 
                utilizing music to perpetuate stereotypes under the guise of entertainment.

            <h2>"What Made the Red Man Red?": Racist Caricature as Entertainment</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGKnCUnAsus" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The song's composition and context reveal its primary function as an exercise in "othering." 
                This isn't subtle stereotyping or "aural shorthand"—it's explicit racist discourse presented 
                as children's entertainment.
            </p>

            <h3>Musical Stereotyping and Exoticism</h3>
            <p>
                The score features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chanting</strong> presented as "primitive" vocalization</li>
                <li><strong>Pervasive use of drums</strong> to signal "Indianness"</li>
                <li><strong>Invented gibberish</strong> like the refrain "Hana Mana Ganda"</li>
                <li><strong>Simplistic rhythmic patterns</strong> that became stereotypes in subsequent media</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "This generalized and inauthentic portrayal, accompanied by drumming, was intended to sound 
                    'Indian' to a Western audience. The use of simplistic drum patterns and repetitive melodies 
                    became a stereotype affixed to Native Americans in subsequent media."
                </p>
                <cite>— Anderson (2019), analysis of Disney's musical stereotyping</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                The music isn't attempting to reference any actual Indigenous musical traditions. Instead, it 
                constructs what Western audiences <em>expect</em> "Indian" music to sound like based on existing 
                Hollywood stereotypes. This is Orientalism at its most crude: the "Orient" (here expanded to 
                include Indigenous Americans) exists only as Western fantasy.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Reinforcement of Colonial Hierarchy</h2>
            
            <p>
                The song attempts to answer questions posed by the white Lost Boys regarding the origins of 
                Indigenous people:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why are they "red"?</li>
                <li>Why do they say "How" and "Ugh"?</li>
                <li>What makes them fundamentally different?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>The Derogatory Content</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses terms like <strong>"Injuns"</strong> and <strong>"squaw"</strong></li>
                    <li>Explains Indigenous people became "red" when an ancestor blushed after a kiss</li>
                    <li>Sexualizes Indigeneity itself through "sexual anticipation" narrative</li>
                    <li>Frames Native Americans as objects of curiosity for white protagonists</li>
                    <li>Presents them as inferior and fundamentally "Other"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The entire sequence is structurally designed to normalize negative stereotypes. The Lost Boys—and 
                by extension, the audience—are positioned as innocently curious observers of an exotic, inferior 
                culture. The Indigenous characters exist only to be explained and examined, not as fully realized 
                people with their own perspectives.

            <h2>The Precedent It Established</h2>
            
            <p>
                This musical approach established a precedent for reducing non-Western cultures to generalized, 
                easily consumable tropes. Even when drawing from source material, the Disney adaptation 
                <strong>"doubled-down on racial stereotypes,"</strong> cementing the practice of prioritizing 
                Western caricature over respectful cultural specificity.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "This early film demonstrates how the music functions ideologically to normalize racial 
                    prejudice and shape perceptions of minority groups as 'other.'"
                </p>
                <cite>— Analysis of Peter Pan's cultural impact</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                The techniques pioneered here—invented "ethnic" sounds, pervasive drums, simplistic rhythms, 
                framing "Others" through white gaze—would continue (in modified form) through Phase I films 
                like <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Pocahontas</em>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>No Pretense of Authenticity</h2>
            
            <p>
                What distinguishes Pre-Phase I from later periods is the complete absence of pretense about 
                authenticity or respect. There was:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No consultation with Indigenous peoples</li>
                <li>No attempt to research actual Indigenous music</li>
                <li>No concern about perpetuating harmful stereotypes</li>
                <li>No response to criticism (because criticism wasn't yet organized/amplified)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The racism was overt, not coded. The stereotyping was explicit, not subtle. This makes 
                <em>Peter Pan</em> easier to critique than later films—but it also reveals the foundation 
                upon which Disney's approach to non-Western cultures was built.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why This Matters for Understanding Later Phases</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Peter Pan</em> is crucial context for evaluating Disney's evolution:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>It shows where Disney started:</strong> Not from ignorance that could be educated, 
                    but from active construction of racial hierarchy through entertainment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>It reveals the underlying logic:</strong> Non-Western peoples exist as objects for 
                    Western consumption and examination, not as subjects with their own authority.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>It establishes patterns:</strong> Many techniques used here (exotic instruments, 
                    invented sounds, positioning through white gaze) persist in modified forms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>It contextualizes "progress":</strong> When we say Disney has "improved," we mean 
                    relative to this baseline—but the fundamental power dynamics may remain unchanged.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>Contemporary Reckoning</h2>
            
            <p>
                Disney now includes content warnings on <em>Peter Pan</em> on Disney+:
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. 
                    These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now."
                </p>
                <cite>— Disney+ content warning</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                However, simply acknowledging past racism without examining <strong>how those patterns persist 
                in modified forms</strong> allows the corporation to appear reformed while maintaining structural 
                control. The warning says the stereotypes were "wrong then"—but what about the more sophisticated 
                stereotyping in Phase I? What about the consultative appropriation of Phase II?
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Peter Pan</em> is easy to condemn because it's so overt. The harder question is whether 
                Disney's later, more subtle methods represent genuine change or merely more sophisticated 
                operations of the same underlying logic.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Pattern Begins</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Peter Pan</em> established the template:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-Western peoples exist for Western entertainment</li>
                <li>Music reduces complex cultures to stereotypical markers</li>
                <li>Creative authority belongs exclusively to Western creators</li>
                <li>Profit flows to Western corporation</li>
                <li>Represented communities have no input or benefit</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This template would evolve—from crude drums and gibberish to "aural shorthand" to consultative 
                appropriation—but the fundamental structure persists. <strong>That's why understanding 
                <em>Peter Pan</em> matters: it shows us what we're measuring progress against, and helps us 
                recognize when apparent change masks continuity in power.</strong>
