            <h2>Overview: The Foundation of Disney's "Othering"</h2>
            <p>
                The history of Disney's non-Western musical representation is rooted in earlier, overt displays of 
                caricature, exemplified by the 1953 film <em>Peter Pan</em>. This film employed a foundational 
                colonial mechanism that predates Phase I, relying on crude, generalized sonic markers and amalgamation 
                to signal exoticism. The song "What Made the Red Man Red?" explicitly reinforced racist discourse, 
                utilizing music to perpetuate stereotypes under the guise of entertainment.

            <h2>"What Made the Red Man Red?": Racist Caricature as Entertainment</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGKnCUnAsus" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The song's composition and context reveal its primary function as an exercise in "othering." 
                This isn't subtle stereotyping or "aural shorthand"—it's explicit racist discourse presented 
                as children's entertainment.
            </p>

            <h3>Musical Stereotyping and Exoticism</h3>
            <p>
                The score features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chanting</strong> presented as "primitive" vocalization</li>
                <li><strong>Pervasive use of drums</strong> to signal "Indianness"</li>
                <li><strong>Invented gibberish</strong> like the refrain "Hana Mana Ganda"</li>
                <li><strong>Simplistic rhythmic patterns</strong> that became stereotypes in subsequent media</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "This generalized and inauthentic portrayal, accompanied by drumming, was intended to sound 
                    'Indian' to a Western audience. The use of simplistic drum patterns and repetitive melodies 
                    became a stereotype affixed to Native Americans in subsequent media."
                </p>
                <cite>— Anderson (2019), analysis of Disney's musical stereotyping</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                The music isn't attempting to reference any actual Indigenous musical traditions. Instead, it 
                constructs what Western audiences <em>expect</em> "Indian" music to sound like based on existing 
                Hollywood stereotypes. This is Orientalism at its most crude: the "Orient" (here expanded to 
                include Indigenous Americans) exists only as Western fantasy.
            </p>

            <h2>Reinforcement of Colonial Hierarchy</h2>
            
            <p>
                The song attempts to answer questions posed by the white Lost Boys regarding the origins of 
                Indigenous people:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why are they "red"?</li>
                <li>Why do they say "How" and "Ugh"?</li>
                <li>What makes them fundamentally different?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>The Derogatory Content</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uses terms like <strong>"Injuns"</strong> and <strong>"squaw"</strong></li>
                    <li>Explains Indigenous people became "red" when an ancestor blushed after a kiss</li>
                    <li>Sexualizes Indigeneity itself through "sexual anticipation" narrative</li>
                    <li>Frames Native Americans as objects of curiosity for white protagonists</li>
                    <li>Presents them as inferior and fundamentally "Other"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The entire sequence is structurally designed to normalize negative stereotypes. The Lost Boys—and 
                by extension, the audience—are positioned as innocently curious observers of an exotic, inferior 
                culture. The Indigenous characters exist only to be explained and examined, not as fully realized 
                people with their own perspectives.

            <h2>The Precedent It Established</h2>
            
            <p>
                This musical approach established a precedent for reducing non-Western cultures to generalized, 
                easily consumable tropes. Even when drawing from source material, the Disney adaptation 
                <strong>"doubled-down on racial stereotypes,"</strong> cementing the practice of prioritizing 
                Western caricature over respectful cultural specificity.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "This early film demonstrates how the music functions ideologically to normalize racial 
                    prejudice and shape perceptions of minority groups as 'other.'"

            </div>

            <p>
                The techniques pioneered here—invented "ethnic" sounds, pervasive drums, simplistic rhythms, 
                framing "Others" through white gaze—would continue (in modified form) through Phase I films 
                like <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Pocahontas</em>.
