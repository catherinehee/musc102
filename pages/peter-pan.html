            <h2>Overview: The Foundation of Disney's "Othering"</h2>
            <p>
                The history of Disney's non-Western musical representation is rooted in earlier, overt displays of 
                caricature, exemplified by the 1953 film <em>Peter Pan</em> (Lugo-Lugo & King, 2010). This film employed a foundational 
                colonial mechanism that predates Phase I, relying on crude, generalized sonic markers and amalgamation 
                to signal exoticism. The song "What Made the Red Man Red?" explicitly reinforced racist discourse, 
                utilizing music to perpetuate stereotypes under the guise of entertainment.

            <h2>"What Made the Red Man Red?": Racist Caricature as Entertainment</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                The song's composition and context reveal its primary function as an exercise in <strong>"othering."</strong> 
                It demonstrates explicit racist discourse presented as children's entertainment.
            </p>

            <h3>Musical Stereotyping and Exoticism</h3>
            <p>
                The score features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chanting</strong> presented as "primitive" vocalization</li>
                <li><strong>Pervasive use of drums</strong> to signal "Indianness"</li>
                <li><strong>Invented gibberish</strong> like the refrain "Hana Mana Ganda"</li>
                <li><strong>Simplistic rhythmic patterns</strong> that became stereotypes in subsequent media</li>
            </ul>


            <p>
                This generalized portrayal was intended to sound 
                'Indian' to a Western audience (Lugo-Lugo & King 2010). The use of simplistic drum patterns and repetitive melodies 
                became a stereotype affixed to Native Americans in subsequent media  (Anderson 2019).
            </p>

            <p>
                The music isn't attempting to reference any actual Indigenous musical traditions. Instead, it 
                constructs what Western audiences <em>expect</em> "Indian" music to sound like based on existing 
                Hollywood stereotypes.

            <h2>Reinforcement of Colonial Hierarchy</h2>
            
            <p>
                The song attempts to answer the questions posed by the white Lost Boys regarding the origins of Indigenous people, including why they are "red" and why they say "How" and "Ugh". The lyrics include derogatory terms like "Injuns" and "squaw". The explanation provided sexualizes indigeneity itself; lyrics reason that Indigenous people became "red" when an ancestor blushed after a kiss, suggesting "sexual anticipation" (Wainer, n.d.).

                The entire musical sequence is structurally designed to frame Native Americans in a stereotypical manner, presenting them as inferior to the white protagonists and normalizing negative stereotypes.

            <h2>The Precedent It Established</h2>
            
            <p>
                This musical approach established a precedent for reducing non-Western cultures to generalized, 
                easily consumable tropes. Even when drawing from source material, the Disney adaptation 
                <strong>"doubled-down on racial stereotypes,"</strong> cementing the practice of prioritizing 
                Western caricature over respectful cultural specificity (Laskow n.d.).
            </p>

            <p>
                The techniques pioneered here—invented "ethnic" sounds, pervasive drums, simplistic rhythms, 
                framing "Others" through white gaze—would continue (in modified form) through Phase I films 
                like <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Pocahontas</em>. This early film demonstrates how the music functions ideologically to normalize racial prejudice and shape perceptions of minority groups as "other".
