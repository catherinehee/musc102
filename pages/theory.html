            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This study employs multiple theoretical frameworks to understand how Disney's musical choices 
                operate ideologically. Each lens reveals different dimensions of power, from the construction 
                of the "Other" to the economic mechanisms that drive cultural extraction.

            <h2>Music as Music Culture</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholars:</strong> Jeff Todd Titon & Mark Slobin
            </p>
            <p>
                Music cultures encompass not only sonic elements but also ideas about music, social organization, 
                and the contexts that give music meaning. Mark Slobin extends this framework to examine power 
                hierarchies between <strong>"supercultures"</strong> (dominant musical systems) and 
                <strong>"subcultures"</strong> (subordinated musical traditions) (Titon, 1996).

                <h3>Application to Disney</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disney extracts musical elements from their original music cultures</li>
                    <li>Recontextualizes them within Western superculture frameworks</li>
                    <li>Teaches audiences to hear non-Western music only through Western paradigms</li>
                    <li>Treats non-Western traditions as repositories of sounds, not living cultures</li>

            <h2>Orientalism</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholar:</strong> Edward Said
            </p>
            <p>
                Orientalism describes how Western culture constructs non-Western societies as exotic, inferior 
                "Others," justifying dominance through representation. Said's framework reveals that the "Orient" 
                is not a real place but a Western construction—a projection of European fantasies and anxieties (Said, 1978).
            </p>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    Orientalism operates through selective imagery that reduces complex cultures to stereotypes 
                    serving Western fantasies (Said, 1978).

            <h2>Cultural Hegemony</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholar:</strong> Antonio Gramsci
            </p>
            <p>
                Gramsci theorized that dominant groups maintain power through <strong>consent</strong> rather than 
                force, making their worldview appear as natural truth. Crucially, hegemonic systems adapt to 
                absorb critique rather than relinquish control—they <strong>evolve their methods while preserving 
                structural dominance</strong> (Gramsci, 1971; El Aidi & Yechouti, 2017).
            </p>
            <p>
                This explains why Disney can appear to change dramatically while fundamental power dynamics 
                persist. Phase II's "consultative appropriation" is hegemony adapting to contemporary critique.

            <h2>Cultural Appropriation vs. Appreciation</h2>
            <p>
                This study distinguishes appropriation from appreciation according to <strong>power dynamics</strong> (Manuel, 2021):
            </p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Cultural Appreciation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reciprocal exchange between groups of relatively equal power</li>
                    <li>Creative authority fairly distributed</li>
                    <li>Source communities benefit materially and retain control</li>
                    <li>Cultural context preserved and respected</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Cultural Appropriation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dominant groups extract cultural elements</li>
                    <li>Power not redistributed to source communities</li>
                    <li>Source communities excluded from creative decisions</li>
                    <li>Profits flow to extractors, not originators</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                By this definition, even Disney's Phase II collaborations constitute appropriation: Indigenous 
                and non-Western consultants provide input, but Western executives and composers retain final 
                authority over creative decisions and profit distribution.

            <h2>Commodity Racism</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholar:</strong> bell hooks
            </p>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    Ethnicity functions as "spice, seasoning that can liven up the dull dish that is mainstream 
                    white culture."

                <cite>— bell hooks, "Eating the Other" (1992)</cite>
            </div>
            <p>
                Under commodity racism, <strong>diversity serves commercial interests while preserving structural 
                inequality</strong>. Cultural collaboration becomes marketable, allowing corporations to profit 
                from appearing culturally-conscious without redistributing power. Difference enhances flavor but 
                never replaces the mainstream foundation (hooks, 1992).

            <h2>Schizophonic Mimesis</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholar:</strong> Steven Feld
            </p>
            <p>
                Building on R. Murray Schafer's concept of <strong>"schizophonia"</strong> (the split between 
                sound and its source through technological reproduction), ethnomusicologist Steven Feld developed 
                <strong>"schizophonic mimesis"</strong> to describe how sound recordings extract Indigenous sounds 
                and "stimulate and license renegotiations of identity," allowing corporations to textualize and 
                reinvent how global audiences understand Indigenous peoples (Feld, 1996).
            </p>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    Through schizophonic mimesis, sound recordings "split from their sources through technological 
                    production and circulation, not only extract Indigenous sounds but stimulate and license 
                    renegotiations of identity," enabling corporations to control representations of Indigenous cultures.

                <h3>Schizophonic Mimesis in Disney</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><em>Aladdin</em>:</strong> Augmented second interval generalized as generic Arab music</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Moana</em>:</strong> Polynesian chants extracted from their genealogical and spiritual functions</li>
                    <li><strong><em>Frozen II</em>:</strong> Sámi joik divorced from its role in reindeer herding and spiritual practice</li>

            <p>
                <strong>Connection to Commodity Racism:</strong> Commodity racism names the economic motive 
                driving appropriation, while schizophonic mimesis reveals the sonic mechanism through which it 
                operates. Together, these concepts show both the <em>why</em> (commercial profit 
                from difference) and the <em>how</em> (sonic extraction, technological reproduction, and identity 
                renegotiation) of musical appropriation.

            <h2>The Culture Industry</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholars:</strong> Theodor Adorno
            </p>
            <p>
                Complementing the concept of commodity racism, Adorno coined the term “culture industry” to describe how mass media subordinates artistic integrity to profit maximization. In other words, cultural creations are standardized to ensure marketability. This concept positions 
                <strong>Western conventions as "universal" emotional language</strong> while treating non-Western 
                structures as financial risk.
            </p>

            <p>
                Disney operates within capitalist logic that demands formulaic creative approaches for 
                maximum profit. The culture industry reveals why commodity racism persists: profit imperatives drive corporations to appease critiques while preserving extractive practices (Adorno & Rabinbach, 1975).

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Orientalism</strong> constructs the "Other" as inferior and exotic</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural hegemony</strong> makes this construction feel natural and inevitable to its audiences</li>
                <li><strong>Music as superculture/subculture</strong> shows how sonic hierarchies operate</li>
                <li><strong>Commodity racism</strong> transforms difference into marketable product</li>
                <li><strong>Schizophonic mimesis</strong> reveals the technical process of sonic extraction and recontextualization</li>
                <li><strong>The culture industry</strong> provides the economic imperative driving the system</li>
