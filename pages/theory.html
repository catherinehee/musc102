            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This study employs multiple theoretical frameworks to understand how Disney's musical choices 
                operate ideologically. Each lens reveals different dimensions of power, from the construction 
                of the "Other" to the economic mechanisms that drive cultural extraction.

            <h2>Music as Music Culture</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholars:</strong> Jeff Todd Titon & Mark Slobin
            </p>
            <p>
                Music cultures encompass not only sonic elements but also ideas about music, social organization, 
                and the contexts that give music meaning. Mark Slobin extends this framework to examine power 
                hierarchies between <strong>"supercultures"</strong> (dominant musical systems) and 
                <strong>"subcultures"</strong> (subordinated musical traditions).
            </p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Application to Disney</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disney extracts musical elements from their original music cultures</li>
                    <li>Recontextualizes them within Western superculture frameworks</li>
                    <li>Teaches audiences to hear non-Western music only through Western paradigms</li>
                    <li>Treats non-Western traditions as repositories of sounds, not living cultures</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Orientalism</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholar:</strong> Edward Said
            </p>
            <p>
                Orientalism describes how Western culture constructs non-Western societies as exotic, inferior 
                "Others," justifying dominance through representation. Said's framework reveals that the "Orient" 
                is not a real place but a Western construction—a projection of European fantasies and anxieties.

                    "Orientalism operates through selective imagery that reduces complex cultures to stereotypes 
                    serving Western fantasies."

                    <li><strong>Aladdin:</strong> Augmented second interval as generic "exotic" marker</li>
                    <li><strong>Mulan:</strong> Pentatonic scales signal "Asian-ness"</li>

            <h2>Cultural Hegemony</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholar:</strong> Antonio Gramsci
            </p>
            <p>
                Gramsci theorized that dominant groups maintain power through <strong>consent</strong> rather than 
                force, making their worldview appear as natural truth. Crucially, hegemonic systems adapt to 
                absorb critique rather than relinquish control—they <strong>evolve their methods while preserving 
                structural dominance</strong>.
            </p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Hegemony's Adaptability</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1950s:</strong> Overt racist caricature accepted as entertainment</li>
                    <li><strong>1990s:</strong> Orientalist stereotypes with better production values</li>
                    <li><strong>2010s-2020s:</strong> Consultation and collaboration that preserve Western control</li>
                    <li>The dominant culture maintains power by absorbing and redefining the "Other"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                This explains why Disney can appear to change dramatically while fundamental power dynamics 
                persist. Phase II's "consultative appropriation" is hegemony adapting to contemporary critique.

            <h2>Cultural Appropriation vs. Appreciation</h2>
            <p>
                This study distinguishes appropriation from appreciation according to <strong>power dynamics</strong>:
            </p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Cultural Appreciation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reciprocal exchange between groups of relatively equal power</li>
                    <li>Creative authority fairly distributed</li>
                    <li>Source communities benefit materially and retain control</li>
                    <li>Cultural context preserved and respected</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Cultural Appropriation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dominant groups extract cultural elements</li>
                    <li>Power not redistributed to source communities</li>
                    <li>Source communities excluded from creative decisions</li>
                    <li>Profits flow to extractors, not originators</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                By this definition, even Disney's Phase II collaborations constitute appropriation: Indigenous 
                and non-Western consultants provide input, but Western executives and composers retain final 
                authority over creative decisions and profit distribution.

            <h2>Commodity Racism</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholar:</strong> bell hooks
            </p>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    Ethnicity functions as "spice, seasoning that can liven up the dull dish that is mainstream 
                    white culture."

                <cite>— bell hooks, "Eating the Other"</cite>
            </div>
            <p>
                Under commodity racism, <strong>diversity serves commercial interests while preserving structural 
                inequality</strong>. Cultural collaboration becomes marketable, allowing corporations to profit 
                from appearing culturally-conscious without redistributing power. Difference enhances flavor but 
                never replaces the mainstream foundation.
            </p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Commodity Racism in Disney Films</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Moana:</strong> Polynesian elements provide "authentic" flavor, Western structures organize</li>
                    <li><strong>Encanto:</strong> Colombian specificity blended into pan-Latin marketability</li>
                    <li><strong>Frozen II:</strong> Sámi culture as exotic texture, not sonic identity</li>
                    <li>Financial motives incentivize extraction over genuine exchange</li>

            <h2>The Culture Industry</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Scholars:</strong> Theodor Adorno & Max Horkheimer
            </p>
            <p>
                The "culture industry" describes how mass media subordinates artistic integrity to profit 
                maximization and standardizes cultural creations to ensure marketability. This logic positions 
                <strong>Western conventions as "universal" emotional language</strong> while treating non-Western 
                structures as financial risk.
            </p>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "The culture industry reveals why commodity racism persists: profit imperatives drive 
                    corporations to appease critiques while preserving extractive practices."

            </div>
            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Culture Industry Logic in Disney</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Executives assume Western = universal, non-Western = risky</li>
                    <li>Economic imperatives override ethnomusicological integrity</li>
                    <li>When Foa'i is told to revise for "English ears," profit dictates authenticity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                The culture industry framework explains <em>why</em> Disney can't simply "choose" to distribute 
                power equally. The corporation operates within capitalist logic that demands standardization for 
                maximum profit. Genuine decolonization would require challenging this fundamental economic structure.

            <h2>Synthesis: How These Frameworks Work Together</h2>
            <p>
                These theoretical lenses are not separate—they illuminate different dimensions of the same system:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Orientalism</strong> constructs the "Other" as inferior and exotic</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural hegemony</strong> makes this construction feel natural and inevitable</li>
                <li><strong>Music as superculture/subculture</strong> shows how sonic hierarchies operate</li>
                <li><strong>Commodity racism</strong> transforms difference into marketable product</li>
                <li><strong>The culture industry</strong> provides the economic imperative driving the system</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Together, they explain how Disney can invite consultants (appearing to change) while maintaining 
                structural control (preserving power). This is not hypocrisy—it's how hegemony adapts to survive 
                critique.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
            <div class="conclusion-box" style="background-color: var(--light-bg); color: var(--text-color); border-left: 6px solid var(--accent-color);">
                <p>
                    <strong>Power doesn't disappear when dominant groups adopt more sophisticated methods.</strong> 
                    Understanding these frameworks allows us to see past superficial changes to identify persistent 
                    structural dynamics. Disney's evolution from Phase I to Phase II represents hegemony's 
                    adaptability, not its dissolution.
