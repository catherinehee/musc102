            <h2>Research Design</h2>
            <p>
                This study employs a <strong>multi-method approach</strong>, combining ethnomusicological analysis 
                of musical scores with critical discourse analysis of production materials. By triangulating 
                multiple data sources, this research builds a comprehensive understanding of how Disney's musical 
                representation has evolved and what drives those changes.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Source Music Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                The primary evidence consists of musical soundtracks from Disney animated films released between 
                1953 and 2021. These scores are analyzed for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Musical structures:</strong> Harmonic progressions, melodic patterns, rhythmic conventions</li>
                <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Which instruments represent which cultures, and why</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural signifiers:</strong> How specific musical elements code for cultural identity</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative function:</strong> Where non-Western vs. Western music appears in the story</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Interviews & Production Materials</h3>
            <p>
                Interviews with both Western composers and non-Western cultural consultants provide crucial insight 
                into creative decision-making. Key sources include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Opetaia Foa'i's interview about being asked to revise for "English ears"</li>
                <li>Composer statements about musical choices</li>
                <li>Disney's corporate communications about cultural trusts</li>
                <li>Cultural consultants' perspectives on the collaboration process</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>Note on limitations:</strong> While available evidence may not fully capture the lived 
                    experiences of all consultants—particularly those who may face contractual constraints—it 
                    provides sufficient basis for analyzing Disney's evolving patterns.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Secondary Ethnomusicological Analyses</h3>
            <p>
                This study draws on analyses from ethnomusicologists and cultural experts who have studied Disney's 
                films. These scholarly works identify how cultural signifiers are deployed through music and 
                examine the ideological implications of those choices.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Critical Cultural Studies Scholarship</h3>
            <p>
                Literature examining Disney's broader societal influence provides context for understanding the 
                corporation's role in shaping cultural perceptions globally.

            <h2>Analytical Framework: Phase-Based Categorization</h2>
            <p>
                To investigate change over time, this study categorizes Disney's musical evolution into distinct 
                periods. <strong>These designations are not official corporate categories</strong> but are 
                constructed here to delineate methodological shifts.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Pre-Phase I: Foundational Colonial Mechanism (1950s)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exemplar:</strong> Peter Pan (1953)</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Overt caricature, crude sonic markers, invented "gibberish"</li>
                    <li><strong>Logic:</strong> No pretense of authenticity; explicit racist discourse</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Dynamic:</strong> Complete exclusion of represented communities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Phase I: The Renaissance Era (1990s-2000s)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exemplars:</strong> Aladdin (1992), Pocahontas (1995), Mulan (1998), Lilo & Stitch (2002)</li>
                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> "Aural shorthand," Orientalist stereotypes, historical sanitization</li>
                    <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Pre-existing colonial tropes deployed as superficial signification</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Dynamic:</strong> Exclusion of cultural creators; Western composers define "Other"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Phase II: The Modern Era (2010s-2020s)</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Formalized collaboration, cultural trusts, advisory boards</li>
                    <li><strong>Logic:</strong> Consultative appropriation; surface authenticity with structural control</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Dynamic:</strong> Managed inclusion; consultants provide input, Western executives decide</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Analytical Methods</h2>

            <h3>Ethnomusicological Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Each film's soundtrack is analyzed for how it deploys musical elements to construct cultural identity:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What sounds signify "Other"?</strong> (e.g., pentatonic scales, specific instruments)</li>
                <li><strong>Where do these sounds appear?</strong> (setting vs. emotional core)</li>
                <li><strong>What structures emotional climax?</strong> (Western vs. non-Western conventions)</li>
                <li><strong>How are consultants' contributions modified?</strong> (e.g., "for English ears")</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Films are compared across phases to identify:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changes in methodology (exclusion → consultation)</li>
                <li>Continuities in power dynamics (Western control maintained)</li>
                <li>Evolution of stereotyping (crude → sophisticated)</li>
                <li>Patterns in which elements are negotiable vs. non-negotiable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Critical Discourse Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                Interview quotes, corporate statements, and production materials are analyzed for what they reveal 
                about decision-making:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who has authority to make final decisions?</li>
                <li>What justifications are given for musical choices?</li>
                <li>How is "authenticity" defined and marketed?</li>
                <li>What constraints do consultants face?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Why This Approach?</h2>
            
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Longitudinal perspective:</strong> Seven decades of data reveal patterns invisible in single cases</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple evidence types:</strong> Music, interviews, scholarship provide robust triangulation</li>
                <li><strong>Theoretical grounding:</strong> Frameworks illuminate power dynamics, not just aesthetic choices</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative design:</strong> Phase-based analysis reveals both change and continuity</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consultant perspectives:</strong> Contractual constraints may limit available testimony</li>
                <li><strong>Selection bias:</strong> Focuses on Walt Disney Animation Studios, not all Disney productions</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural specificity:</strong> Analysis cannot equally represent all depicted cultures</li>
                <li><strong>Interpreter positionality:</strong> All analysis is filtered through researcher perspective</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why These Limitations Don't Undermine Findings</h3>
            <p>
                While this study cannot capture every consultant's experience or analyze every Disney production, 
                <strong>the patterns are clear and consistent</strong>. When Foa'i describes being asked to modify 
                for "English ears," when Beck dismisses joik as "Hey Na Na music," when Encanto blends Cuban and 
                Colombian music—these aren't isolated incidents. They're evidence of systematic structural dynamics 
                that persist across decades, films, and represented cultures.

            <h2>Criteria for Evidence</h2>
            <p>
                Claims in this study are supported by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Musical evidence:</strong> Audible features of soundtracks</li>
                <li><strong>Direct testimony:</strong> Quotes from composers and consultants</li>
                <li><strong>Scholarly analysis:</strong> Peer-reviewed ethnomusicological studies</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern identification:</strong> Recurring dynamics across multiple cases</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                By requiring multiple forms of evidence, this methodology avoids relying on speculation or 
                unfounded claims about intent. When we say "Western control is maintained," we point to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Who holds final decision-making authority (documented)</li>
                <li>How consultants' contributions are modified (testified)</li>
                <li>Where non-Western music appears in narrative (audible)</li>
                <li>What patterns repeat across films (comparative)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Research Questions</h2>
            <p>
                This methodology is designed to answer:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>How has Disney's musical representation of non-Western cultures evolved since the 1950s?</li>
                <li>What drove these transformations? (Criticism? Market forces? Genuine values change?)</li>
                <li>Do changes represent genuine decolonization or adaptation of colonial methods?</li>
                <li>How do musical choices communicate ideology beyond their explicit content?</li>
                <li>What would genuine redistribution of creative authority look like?</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion: Why Methodology Matters</h2>
            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    The question isn't whether Disney has changed—clearly it has. The question is whether those 
                    changes represent redistribution of power or sophisticated adaptation of hegemony. This 
                    methodology is designed to distinguish between the two.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                By analyzing not just what music sounds like, but <strong>who controls its creation</strong> and 
                <strong>how it functions ideologically</strong>, this research reveals patterns that might otherwise 
                remain invisible. The evidence shows that while Disney's methods have evolved dramatically, the 
                fundamental power dynamics—Western control over representation of non-Western cultures—persist.
