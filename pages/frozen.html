            <h2>Overview: The Critique That Changed Everything</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Frozen</em> (2013) became a cultural phenomenon and Disney's highest-grossing animated film at the time. 
                However, its treatment of Scandinavian and particularly Sámi cultural elements drew criticism that would 
                fundamentally change Disney's approach to cultural representation. This film represents a transition point 
                between Phase I's crude stereotyping and Phase II's consultative model.

            <h2>"Let It Go": Global Phenomenon</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">

            </div>

            <p>
                "Let It Go" became a global phenomenon, topping charts in multiple countries and winning the Academy Award 
                for Best Original Song. Composed by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, it's a quintessential Broadway 
                power ballad — musically, it could be set anywhere, at any time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The song exemplifies what had become Disney's standard approach: use Western musical theater conventions 
                for emotional core while cultural specificity remains visual. The Norwegian/Nordic setting functions as 
                aesthetic backdrop, not sonic identity.

            <h2>The Generic "Frozen North"</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Frozen</em> presented a generic Nordic fantasy aesthetic — fjords, reindeer, ice palaces, and vague 
                Scandinavian cultural markers. While the film featured some Norwegian-inspired visual elements, it made 
                no meaningful engagement with Sámi culture, despite the region's Indigenous people.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Cultural Elements in Frozen (2013)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kristoff's character loosely inspired by Sámi ice harvesters</li>
                    <li>Reindeer herding as comedic backdrop</li>
                    <li>Opening features Frode Fjellheim's joik-inspired "Vuelie"</li>
                    <li>No Sámi consultation or meaningful representation</li>
                    <li>Sámi elements used decoratively for "exotic" flavor</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>"Vuelie": Decorative Authenticity</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mta2iSqEMJw" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film's opening features "Vuelie" (also known as "Eatnemen Vuelie" or "Song of the Earth"), composed 
                by Norwegian Sámi musician Frode Fjellheim. This piece authentically incorporates joik — the traditional 
                Sámi form of song.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this authentic element functions as exotic opening flavor, quickly giving way to standard Western 
                orchestral and Broadway musical conventions for the film's narrative core. Joik appears and disappears, 
                serving as cultural seasoning rather than structural foundation.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    The use of joik in the opening creates an "exotic" atmosphere that signals "Northern magic" to 
                    audiences, but the music is decontextualized from its cultural and spiritual meanings.

            <h2>The Sámi Criticism</h2>
            
            <p>
                Sámi communities and cultural advocates criticized <em>Frozen</em> for appropriating visual and cultural 
                elements without consultation, representation, or acknowledgment. Key concerns included:
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Sámi Community Concerns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Kristoff portrayed as comedic, uncultured side character</li>
                    <li>No acknowledgment of Sámi people in film or credits</li>
                    <li>Sámi-inspired elements used without consultation</li>
                    <li>Generic Nordic fantasy erased specific Indigenous identity</li>
                    <li>Profited from cultural borrowing without community benefit</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This criticism reflected broader concerns about cultural appropriation in media — taking cultural elements 
                for commercial gain while excluding the communities those elements come from. For Sámi people, who have 
                faced centuries of colonization and cultural suppression, this felt like a continuation of historical patterns.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
            
            <p>
                The criticism of <em>Frozen</em> came at a cultural moment when audiences were increasingly attuned to 
                issues of representation and cultural appropriation. Social media amplified these concerns, and Disney 
                faced pressure to respond.
            </p>

            <p>
                This pressure led to a significant shift in corporate strategy. For <em>Frozen II</em>, Disney would 
                implement a formalized collaborative model, partnering with <em>verddet</em>, a Sámi advisory group. 
                This marked the corporation's explicit acknowledgment that its previous approach was insufficient.

            <h2>What Frozen Reveals About Phase I Logic</h2>
            
            <p>
                Despite being released in 2013, <em>Frozen</em> operated largely on Phase I logic:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visual borrowing without consultation:</strong> Taking cultural elements as aesthetic resources</li>
                <li><strong>Decorative authenticity:</strong> Using joik for exotic flavor, not narrative structure</li>
                <li><strong>Western musical core:</strong> Broadway conventions for all emotional depth</li>
                <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> No acknowledgment of Sámi people despite cultural borrowing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                However, unlike <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Pocahontas</em>, <em>Frozen</em> faced immediate, organized 
                criticism that Disney could not ignore. The cultural conversation had shifted, and the corporation 
                would need to adapt.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Lessons Learned (Sort Of)</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Frozen</em>'s success — over $1.28 billion at the box office — proved that cultural specificity was 
                not necessary for commercial success. Yet the criticism revealed that audiences and advocacy groups were 
                increasingly unwilling to accept uncritical cultural appropriation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Disney's response with <em>Frozen II</em> would attempt to thread this needle: maintain commercial appeal 
                through familiar Western musical structures while adding visible markers of consultation and respect. 
                Whether this represents genuine progress or sophisticated adaptation of power remains the central question 
                of Phase II analysis.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Frozen</em> remains one of Disney's most successful and beloved films. "Let It Go" became an anthem 
                of self-acceptance for millions. The film's positive impacts — particularly for young audiences exploring 
                identity and familial love — are real and meaningful.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, its treatment of Sámi culture demonstrates how even well-intentioned creative work can perpetuate 
                patterns of cultural erasure when power remains concentrated in Western institutions. The film's legacy 
                includes both its cultural impact and the important conversations it sparked about representation, 
                consultation, and cultural responsibility.
