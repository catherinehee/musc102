            <h2>Overview: The Critique That Changed Everything</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Frozen</em> (2013) became a cultural phenomenon and Disney's highest-grossing animated film at the time. 
                However, its treatment of Scandinavian and particularly Sámi cultural elements drew criticism that would 
                fundamentally change Disney's approach to cultural representation. This film represents a transition point 
                between Phase I's crude stereotyping and Phase II's consultative model.

            <h2>"Let It Go": Global Phenomenon</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                "Let It Go" became a global phenomenon, topping charts in multiple countries and winning the Academy Award 
                for Best Original Song. Composed by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, it's a quintessential Broadway 
                power ballad — musically, it could be set anywhere, at any time.
            </p>

            <p>
                The song exemplifies what had become Disney's standard approach: use Western musical theater conventions 
                for emotional core while cultural specificity remains visual. The Norwegian/Nordic setting functions as 
                aesthetic backdrop, not sonic identity.

            <h2>The Generic "Frozen North"</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Frozen</em> presented a generic Nordic fantasy aesthetic — fjords, reindeer, ice palaces, and vague 
                Scandinavian cultural markers. While the film featured some Norwegian-inspired visual elements, it made 
                no meaningful engagement with Sámi culture, despite the region's Indigenous people. Kristoff's character 
                was loosely inspired by Sámi ice harvesters, with reindeer herding serving as comedic backdrop. The opening 
                features Frode Fjellheim's joik-inspired "Vuelie," but there was no Sámi consultation or meaningful 
                representation—Sámi elements were used decoratively for "exotic" flavor.

            <h2>"Vuelie": Decorative Authenticity</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">

            </div>

            <p>
                The film's opening features "Vuelie" (also known as "Eatnemen Vuelie" or "Song of the Earth"), composed 
                by Norwegian Sámi musician Frode Fjellheim. This piece authentically incorporates joik — the traditional 
                Sámi form of song.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this authentic element functions as exotic opening flavor, quickly giving way to standard Western 
                orchestral and Broadway musical conventions for the film's narrative core. Joik appears and disappears, 
                serving as cultural seasoning rather than structural foundation.

                <p>
                    The use of joik in the opening creates an "exotic" atmosphere that signals "Northern magic" to 
                    audiences, but the music is decontextualized from its cultural and spiritual meanings.

            <h2>The Criticism That Led to Change</h2>
            
            <p>
                Following criticism of Frozen (2013) for its superficial use of generalized Scandinavian motifs, Disney 
                implemented a formalized partnership for Frozen II (2019). The criticism of <em>Frozen</em> centered on 
                its appropriation of Sámi cultural elements without consultation, representation, or acknowledgment. This 
                led Disney to form <em>verddet</em>, marking a shift in corporate strategy toward managed inclusion for 
                the sequel.
