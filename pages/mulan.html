            <h2>Overview: Musical Orientalism and Ideological Binaries</h2>
            <p>
                The music of <em>Mulan</em> (1998) exemplifies musical Orientalism, where Disney abstracted Chinese 
                cultural elements and reconfigured them to conform to Western commercial demands. Although the film's 
                plot is based on Chinese folklore, the score prioritized Euro-American musical structures while using 
                stereotypical "Asian-sounding" elements to create exotic atmosphere.

            <h2>The Orientalist Musical Architecture</h2>
            
            <p>
                The score, composed by non-Chinese American Jerry Goldsmith, prioritized Western symphonic structures 
                deemed necessary to remain "palatable" to Western audiences. This decision reveals a crucial assumption: 
                Chinese musical traditions are insufficient for conveying universal emotion to global (read: Western) audiences.
            </p>

            <h3>"Honor to Us All": Pentatonic Shorthand</h3>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1S9pYmpkG8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                "Honor to Us All" relies on broad musical stereotypes, specifically <strong>pentatonic scales</strong> 
                and generalized melodic phrases that American viewers had long been conditioned to interpret as 
                "Asian-sounding." This is the 1990s version of <em>Peter Pan</em>'s drums and chanting—more 
                sophisticated, but operating on the same logic.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>What Pentatonic Scales Signal</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used across many Asian musical traditions, but not uniquely Chinese</li>
                    <li>Functions as generalized "Orient" marker in Western media</li>
                    <li>Creates instant recognition for Western audiences: "This is Asia"</li>
                    <li>Actual Chinese musical complexity reduced to recognizable pattern</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Like the augmented second in <em>Aladdin</em>, the pentatonic scale functions as "aural shorthand"—
                a sonic stereotype that signals exoticism without requiring genuine engagement with Chinese musical 
                traditions. It's what Western audiences <em>expect</em> Chinese music to sound like, based on decades 
                of Hollywood Orientalism.

            <h2>Musical Binaries: East vs. West as Repression vs. Liberation</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Mulan</em>'s score reinforces an ideological binary: Eastern values are musically coded as 
                repressive and backwards, while Western values are coded as liberating and progressive. This isn't 
                subtle—it's a systematic pattern throughout the film.
            </p>

            <h3>"Reflection": Western Music for Individualism</h3>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed?v=1BtlAw4trg</iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                When Mulan pursues individualism—aligning her with progressive American values—the corresponding 
                music is <strong>exclusively Western in style</strong>. "Reflection" is a standard pop ballad that 
                could appear in any contemporary American film. There are no pentatonic scales, no "Asian" signifiers.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "This explicit pairing communicates to the audience that Eastern values are backwards and 
                    repressive."
                </p>
                <cite>— Amer (2022), "I'll Make an American Out of You"</cite>
            </div>

            <h3>The Pattern</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chinese tradition (arranged marriage, gender roles):</strong> Pentatonic themes, "Oriental" orchestration</li>
                <li><strong>Individual freedom (Mulan's self-discovery):</strong> Western pop ballad structure</li>
                <li><strong>The message:</strong> To be free, one must adopt Western musical language</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This creates a deeply problematic narrative: Chinese culture is presented as inherently oppressive, 
                and liberation requires embracing Western (American) values. The music doesn't just accompany this 
                message—it <em>is</em> this message.
            </p>

            <h2>"I'll Make a Man Out of You": Militarism and Westernization</h2>
            
            <p>
                The film's most famous song employs a driving Western rock structure to accompany Mulan's military 
                training. While set in ancient China, the musical language is unmistakably contemporary Western—
                because the values being taught (individual excellence, meritocracy, gender transcendence) are 
                coded as American, not Chinese.
            </p>

            <p>
                The irony: a film celebrating Chinese folklore ultimately communicates that Chinese musical traditions 
                are inadequate for expressing its heroine's journey. Only Western music can convey her transformation 
                into an empowered individual.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Exclusion Problem</h2>
            
            <p>
                Like <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Mulan</em> excluded Chinese musicians from substantive creative roles. 
                Jerry Goldsmith, a Western composer, made decisions about what "sounds Chinese" based on Hollywood 
                conventions, not consultation with Chinese musical traditions or practitioners.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>What Genuine Engagement Would Look Like</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chinese composers with authority over musical decisions</li>
                    <li>Exploration of actual Chinese musical forms (not just pentatonic scales)</li>
                    <li>Chinese instruments used structurally, not decoratively</li>
                    <li>Chinese musical traditions allowed to convey emotional depth</li>
                    <li>Not assuming Western music = universal, Chinese music = specific</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                Instead, <em>Mulan</em> treats Chinese music as atmospheric decoration—present in establishing shots 
                and cultural markers, absent from emotional core. This is the Phase I pattern: the "Other" provides 
                exotic flavor; Western hegemony structures narrative substance.
            </p>

            <h2>The "Empowerment" Paradox</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Mulan</em> is often celebrated as a feminist Disney film, and legitimately so in many ways. 
                However, the musical choices reveal a troubling subtext: Mulan's empowerment is coded as 
                <em>Westernization</em>.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "The film suggests that to be empowered, Chinese women must adopt American values—and 
                    American musical language."
                </p>
                <cite>— Analysis of Mulan's ideological implications</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                This reflects broader Orientalist logic: the "Orient" is backwards and oppressive; the West is 
                progressive and liberating. By musically coding this binary, <em>Mulan</em> reinforces Western 
                cultural superiority even while appearing to celebrate Chinese culture.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Comparison to Phase II</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Mulan</em> represents Phase I logic at its most ideologically explicit:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complete Western control</strong> over creative decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Stereotypical signifiers</strong> (pentatonic scales) for "authenticity"</li>
                <li><strong>Binary opposition</strong> between Eastern (bad) and Western (good) values</li>
                <li><strong>No consultation</strong> with represented community</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                A Phase II version might include Chinese consultants and composers. But would they have authority 
                to structure emotional climax with Chinese musical forms? Based on <em>Moana</em> and <em>Frozen II</em>, 
                probably not. Consultation provides legitimacy, but Western conventions would still define "universal" 
                emotional language.

            <h2>Legacy and Cultural Impact</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Mulan</em> became a cultural phenomenon and introduced millions to Chinese folklore. However, 
                its musical representation taught audiences that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese music = pentatonic scales and exotic instruments</li>
                <li>Real emotion requires Western musical structures</li>
                <li>Chinese tradition = repression; Western values = liberation</li>
                <li>Empowerment means adopting Western cultural forms</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These lessons have lasting impact. For non-Chinese audiences, <em>Mulan</em> may be their primary 
                exposure to Chinese culture. For Chinese audiences, especially diaspora children, the film's message 
                about which musical traditions can convey authentic emotion has psychological implications.

            <h2>The 2020 Live-Action Remake</h2>
            
            <p>
                The 2020 live-action <em>Mulan</em> attempted to address some criticisms by removing musical numbers 
                entirely and consulting with Chinese creatives. However, this raises its own questions: Why is the 
                solution to remove music rather than redistribute creative authority to Chinese composers? Does 
                elimination of the problem equal genuine progress?
