            <h2>Overview: Musical Orientalism and Ideological Binaries</h2>
            <p>
                The music of <em>Mulan</em> (1998) exemplifies musical Orientalism, where Disney abstracted Chinese 
                cultural elements and reconfigured them to conform to Western commercial demands. Although the film's 
                plot is based on Chinese folklore, the score prioritized Euro-American musical structures while using 
                stereotypical "Asian-sounding" elements to create exotic atmosphere.

            <h2>The Orientalist Musical Architecture</h2>
            
            <p>
                The score, composed by non-Chinese American Jerry Goldsmith, prioritized Western symphonic structures 
                deemed necessary to remain "palatable" to Western audiences. This decision reveals a crucial assumption: 
                Chinese musical traditions are insufficient for conveying universal emotion to global (read: Western) audiences.

            <h3>"Honor to Us All": Pentatonic Shorthand</h3>

            <p>
                In the song "Honor to Us All," its composers relied on broad musical stereotypes, specifically pentatonic 
                scales and generalized melodic phrases, which American viewers had long been conditioned to interpret 
                as "Asian-sounding" (Amer, 2022).

            <h2>Musical Binaries: East vs. West as Repression vs. Liberation</h2>
            
            <h3>Musical Binaries</h3>
            
            <p>
                This musical architecture subtly reinforces a binary dichotomy between Eastern and Western ideologies. When 
                Mulan pursued individualism, aligning her with progressive American values, the corresponding music, 
                such as her solo "Reflection," was exclusively Western in style (Amer, 2022).
            </p>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_BtlAw4trg?si=EGL9QiM-Nk9RSp88"</iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                Conversely, scenes depicting oppressive aspects of Chinese society, like antiquated gender roles, were 
                accompanied with a more stylized "Oriental" sound, utilizing aforementioned pentatonic themes; <strong>this 
                explicit pairing communicates to the audience that Eastern values are backwards and repressive</strong>.
