            <h2>Overview: Sanitizing History Through Music</h2>
            <p>
                Disney's <em>Pocahontas</em> (1995) functions as a historical sanitization project, romanticizing the 
                violent colonial encounter between the Powhatan people and European settlers. The film's music plays 
                a crucial role in transforming genocide into a story of mutual misunderstanding and environmental harmony.

            <h2>"Savages": False Equivalence</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                The song "Savages" represents genocide as a misunderstanding <em>from both sides</em>, equating Indigenous 
                resistance with colonial violence and effectively erasing the historical power imbalance of the conflict (Petschow 2014). 
                The song's dramatic orchestration and parallel structure creates false equivalence between colonizer 
                and colonized under an inaccurate representation of history.

            <p>
                "Colors of the Wind" employs a Western pop ballad structure that simplifies colonialism's complexity (Menken & Schwartz 1995). 
                It highlights what scholars call the <strong>"postcolonial exotic"</strong> by crafting a "safe" version 
                of Indigeneity that appeals to Western romanticism while stripping away harsh reality (Devipriya & Mishra 2025).

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "You think you own whatever land you land on / The earth is just a dead thing you can claim / 
                    But I know every rock and tree and creature / Has a life, has a spirit, has a name"
                </p>
                <cite>— "Colors of the Wind" lyrics</cite>
            </div>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            
            <p>
                <strong>1. Cultural Displacement:</strong> The lyrics articulate Indigenous ecological wisdom, but they're 
                derived from a fabricated speech, displacing specific Powhatan worldviews with generalized environmentalism (Pewewardy 1996). 
                Even the iconic "blue corn moon" imagery was invented for sonic appeal, drawn from the Algonquian "green corn moon" (Schwartz 2010).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>2. Genocide? No. Environmental Conflict!:</strong> The music overlooks past genocidal violence 
                and reframes colonization as environmental conflict. Environmentalism is a universal problem that doesn't directly 
                confront Western society (Devipriya & Mishra 2025). Pocahontas becomes <strong>"indigenous in aesthetic but universal in appeal,"</strong> 
                as the movie prioritizes its audience's comfort over historical accountability (Devipriya & Mishra 2025).
