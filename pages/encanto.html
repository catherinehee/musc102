            <h2>A Successful Collaboration with Persistent Problems</h2>
            <p>
                The musical representation in <em>Encanto</em> (2021) is one of Disney's more successful examples 
                of its new collaborative paradigm, succeeding in cultural celebration by foregrounding inclusion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Encanto successfully showcases and celebrates Colombian heritage, distancing the country from previous 
                negative stereotypes of drug trafficking and violence. Its soundtrack—developed after Lin-Manuel Miranda 
                and the filmmaking team conducted research on the ground in Colombia—integrates distinctly local musical 
                elements, including traditional genres such as bambuco and vallenato, and instruments like the marimba 
                and arpa llanera. Germaine Franco, an American-born Latina composer, infused the score with Colombian 
                rhythmic structures and collaborated with Colombian recording artists, most notably Sebastián Yatra.

            <p>
                This commitment to structural inclusion, where culturally affiliated creators hold key roles, helped 
                deliver a nuanced, affirming narrative that highlights the Colombian values of family and tradition. The 
                soundtrack received widespread critical acclaim and monumental commercial success, demonstrating that 
                films with authentic cultural foundations can achieve massive global popularity.

            <h2>"Dos Oruguitas"</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                Notably, "Dos Oruguitas" is an all Spanish-language song that critics perceive to be Encanto's best song.

            <h2>Cultural Amalgamation</h2>
            
            <p>
                Despite high praise, even Encanto demonstrates a persistent trend toward cultural amalgamation and 
                centralized control.
            </p>
            
            <h3>"We Don't Talk About Bruno"</h3>

                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bvWRMAU6V-c" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                While the music draws on Colombian specifics, the soundtrack blends distinct ethnocultural sounds into 
                broader, marketable pan-Latin genres. For example, the popular song "We Don't Talk About Bruno" primarily 
                uses the guajira rhythm characteristic of Cuban son:
            </p>

                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VCxWPhP4XI" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                This deliberate amalgamation contributes to assimilation, where distinct ethnocultural groups are blended 
                into one, implying absorption into the mainstream Latin (like the Oriental "Other") identity acceptable 
                to a mass audience.

            <h3>"The Dysfunctional Tango"</h3>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LikmGyZylA" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film also features a track titled "The Dysfunctional Tango" in an Argentine style.

            <h3>"Waiting on a Miracle": Simplified Bambuco</h3>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKKrfr4To14" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film's attempt to incorporate the Colombian bambuco genre in the song "Waiting on a Miracle" was 
                critiqued for lacking its characteristic polymetric nature where "binary and ternary durations overlap 
                rhythmically [and] binary and ternary melodic articulations alternate."
            </p>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48i4gnrYFCw" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The resulting composition was noted for sounding like generic "folk" rather than authentic bambuco, and 
                its simplified rhythmic character meant the musical arrangement prioritized a Western waltz-like form 
                for broad audience appeal.
