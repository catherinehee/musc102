            <h2>Overview: Superficial Hawaiianness</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> (2002) represents a transition point in Disney's approach to cultural 
                representation. More respectful than earlier Phase I films like <em>Aladdin</em> and <em>Pocahontas</em>, 
                it nonetheless treats Hawaiian culture as scenic backdrop rather than narrative substance. The film's 
                musical choices reveal persistent patterns: Indigenous culture provides setting, Western pop conventions 
                provide emotional core.

            <h2>"Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride": Elvis, Not Hawaii</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vx6bOdFqcOU" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film's most prominent original song, "Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride," is performed by a Hawaiian 
                language choir and incorporates some traditional elements. However, the song's fundamental structure 
                is <strong>Elvis-inspired pop</strong>, not traditional Hawaiian music.
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>What This Reveals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hawaiian language used for "authentic" flavor</li>
                    <li>Musical structure remains Western pop/rock</li>
                    <li>References Elvis (who popularized Hawaiian exoticism for mainland audiences)</li>
                    <li>Traditional Hawaiian music appears briefly, then disappears</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The reference to Elvis is particularly revealing. Elvis Presley's 1960s Hawaiian films exemplified 
                commodity tourism: Hawaii as exotic backdrop for white American fantasies. By structuring its "Hawaiian" 
                song around Elvis-style conventions, <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> perpetuates this dynamic.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Traditional Hawaiian Music: Present but Peripheral</h2>
            
            <p>
                The film does include moments of traditional Hawaiian music—slack key guitar, ukulele, mele (song). 
                These appear during establishing shots, cultural moments (like hula), and atmospheric sequences. 
                However, they function as <strong>cultural decoration</strong>, not narrative substance.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "While more respectful than earlier films, <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> treated Hawaiian culture as 
                    scenic backdrop. Traditional music appears briefly but emotional core remains Western pop conventions."

            <p>
                This continues the Phase I pattern established in <em>Aladdin</em>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Setting/atmosphere:</strong> Indigenous/non-Western musical elements</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional depth/character development:</strong> Western pop/rock structures</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Elvis Soundtrack Strategy</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> famously features multiple Elvis Presley songs throughout the film. This 
                creative choice serves multiple functions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Commercial appeal:</strong> Familiar songs for mainstream audiences</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional resonance:</strong> Elvis provides the film's emotional moments</li>
                <li><strong>Character development:</strong> Lilo's love of Elvis defines her personality</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural connection:</strong> Elvis filmed in Hawaii, so it's "appropriate"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                However, this strategy reveals troubling implications: Why is Elvis—a white mainland American who 
                commodified Hawaiian exoticism—more suitable for emotional depth than actual Hawaiian musical traditions? 
                Why is Lilo defined by her love of Western pop culture rather than Hawaiian cultural practices?
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>What Gets Prioritized</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hawaiian cultural practices:</strong> Hula as spectacle/tradition</li>
                    <li><strong>Elvis songs:</strong> Emotional connection, character identity, narrative development</li>
                    <li><strong>The message:</strong> Western pop culture is universal; Hawaiian culture is specific/local</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>'Ohana: Commodifying Hawaiian Values</h2>
            
            <p>
                The film popularized the Hawaiian concept of <em>'ohana</em> (family) globally. "Ohana means family, 
                and family means nobody gets left behind" became a cultural phenomenon. This represents both positive 
                representation and problematic commodification.
            </p>

            <h3>Positive Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduced Hawaiian language to global audiences</li>
                <li>Centered Hawaiian values in narrative</li>
                <li>Created positive associations with Hawaiian culture</li>
                <li>Avoided crude stereotyping of earlier films</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Commodification Concerns</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>'Ohana reduced to simplified slogan for merchandising</li>
                <li>Complex Hawaiian cultural concept made easily consumable</li>
                <li>Profits flow to Disney, not Hawaiian communities</li>
                <li>Cultural value extracted and repackaged for Western consumption</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This exemplifies bell hooks' commodity racism: Hawaiian culture functions as "spice" that enhances 
                the mainstream dish. 'Ohana is welcomed because it fits Western sentimentality about family—if it 
                challenged Western values, would it have been centered?

            <h2>Visual vs. Sonic Representation</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> is often praised for its visual representation of Hawaii—accurate depictions 
                of landscapes, architecture, and daily life. However, the contrast between visual and sonic representation 
                is instructive:
            </p>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Visual Representation: Relatively Accurate</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contemporary Hawaiian life, not romanticized past</li>
                    <li>Mixed race families and communities</li>
                    <li>Economic realities (Nani's jobs, financial struggles)</li>
                    <li>Authentic locations and architecture</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Sonic Representation: Western-Dominated</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elvis provides emotional core</li>
                    <li>Western pop structures for original songs</li>
                    <li>Traditional Hawaiian music decorative/atmospheric</li>
                    <li>Character identity defined by Western cultural consumption</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This pattern appears again in Phase II films: visual accuracy improves while sonic identity remains 
                Western-controlled. Apparently, what Hawaii <em>looks like</em> can be authentic, but what it 
                <em>sounds like</em> must conform to Western commercial expectations.

            <h2>The "Assimilate to American Customs" Message</h2>
            
            <p>
                Scholars Eshow and Lundsgaard (2023) argue that <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> ultimately communicates that 
                Hawaiian characters must assimilate to American customs. Lilo's "weirdness"—which includes her 
                connection to Hawaiian cultural practices—is portrayed as something that causes problems and must be 
                moderated.
            </p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>
                    "The narrative suggests that Lilo's salvation comes through her bond with Stitch and Nani's 
                    boyfriend David, who represent more 'normal' (read: Americanized) values, rather than through 
                    deeper engagement with Hawaiian cultural traditions."
                </p>
                <cite>— Eshow & Lundsgaard (2023)</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                The musical choices reinforce this message: Elvis (American cultural icon) provides emotional resolution, 
                while traditional Hawaiian practices remain on the periphery. Integration into mainstream American 
                culture, not Hawaiian cultural grounding, solves the narrative problem.
            </p>

            <h2>Transition, Not Transformation</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> represents a transitional moment:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Better than Phase I:</strong> More respectful, avoids crude stereotypes</li>
                <li><strong>Not yet Phase II:</strong> No formalized collaboration or consultation</li>
                <li><strong>Still Phase I logic:</strong> Western music = emotional core, Indigenous music = decoration</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The film demonstrates that Disney could improve visual representation and avoid overt Orientalism 
                while still maintaining sonic hegemony. This suggests that what would later become Phase II's 
                "consultative appropriation" was already taking shape: welcome cultural elements that enhance 
                marketability, but preserve Western control over emotional narrative.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What Would Genuine Representation Look Like?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Imagine a version of <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Traditional Hawaiian mele (song) structures emotional climax</li>
                <li>Hawaiian composers have creative authority</li>
                <li>Lilo's identity centers on Hawaiian cultural practices, not Elvis fandom</li>
                <li>Western pop serves as decorative contrast, not emotional core</li>
                <li>Hawaiian musical complexity allowed to drive narrative</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This version would challenge executives' assumptions about commercial viability. Would mainstream 
                audiences accept Hawaiian musical traditions as "universal" emotional language? Disney has never 
                tested this assumption—and until they do, we can't know whether it's valid or merely self-fulfilling 
                prophecy.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            
            <p>
                <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> became beloved and introduced many to Hawaiian language and values. Its impact 
                on Hawaiian and Pacific Islander representation in mainstream media shouldn't be dismissed. However, 
                its patterns—Indigenous culture as backdrop, Western pop as substance—would persist into Phase II.
            </p>

            <p>
                The film proves Disney could move beyond crude Orientalism (Phase I's worst) while maintaining sonic 
                hegemony (Phase I's core logic). This makes it an important case study: progress in representation 
                doesn't necessarily mean redistribution of creative authority.
