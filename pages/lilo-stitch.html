            <h2>A Complex Case: Celebrating, Yet Assimilating</h2>
            <p>
                The musical architecture of <em>Lilo & Stitch</em> (2002) presents a complex case of cultural engagement, 
                simultaneously celebrating Indigenous Hawaiian culture while subtly reinforcing the dynamics of Western 
                assimilation. The score's most direct and profound commentary is achieved through the integration of specific, 
                highly symbolic Hawaiian songs.

            <h2>Symbolic Hawaiian Songs</h2>
            
            <h3>"He Mele No Lilo"</h3>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvznYJEFh1w" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The film's introductory musical piece, "He Mele No Lilo," is a tribute to King Kalakaua and Queen 
                Liliʻuokalani, the last monarchs of Hawaiʻi. This song is performed entirely in Hawaiian, though its true 
                meaning is lost on the majority of the Western audience (Kim & Gregory, 2023).
            </p>

            <h3>"Aloha 'Oe"</h3>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6cYHXcWAN0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                Furthermore, the film uses "Aloha 'Oe," a notable Indigenous Hawaiian song written by Queen Liliuokalani, 
                which symbolizes the historical loss of the Hawaiian Kingdom to Western rule. When the character Nani sings this song to Lilo, facing imminent separation by Child Protective Services, she symbolically links 
                her family's plight to the subjugation of the Hawaiian people by the U.S. government (Casley, 2016), casting the government 
                agency as the antagonist. This musical reference acts as the film's "most direct textual commentary of American 
                colonization" (Kim & Gregory, 2023).

            <h2>The Western Soundtrack</h2>
            
            <p>
                However, the dominant nondiegetic soundtrack asserts a normalizing Western musical presence, 
                prioritizing familiarity for the American audience. The film relies heavily on American cultural markers, 
                particularly Lilo's obsession with Elvis Presley, whose music Lilo uses in her attempts to teach Stitch about American culture.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The influence of Elvis Presley is significant, as his own filmography aided in the gentrification 
                of Hawaiʻi by presenting it as an exotic island paradise. This inclusion of his music reinforces the colonial 
                gaze, compelling Stitch to assimilate to American customs (Eshow & Lundsgaard, 2023).
