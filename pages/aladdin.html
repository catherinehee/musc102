            <h2>Overview: Orientalism in Action</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Aladdin</em> (1992) deploys Orientalist musical tactics that define the Arab world as savage and inferior. 
                The film exemplifies Phase I of Disney's approach: exclusion, stereotyping, and the deployment of music as 
                superficial signification rather than culturally informed representation.

                <p>"Where they cut off your ear / If they don't like your face / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."</p>
                <cite>— Original lyrics to "Arabian Nights" (later revised after protests)</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                The opening song, "Arabian Nights," initially described the Middle Eastern setting as a place of barbarism and violence. 
                While protests forced a lyrical revision, the retained line, "It's barbaric, but hey, it's home," signaled the film's 
                ideological stance. The lyrics frame the setting through a "white gaze," geographically and morally positioning 
                American culture as superior to the depicted "Other."

            <h2>Musical Orientalism: "Aural Shorthand"</h2>
            
            <p>
                Musically, composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman utilized <strong>"aural shorthands"</strong> — recognizable 
                markers of exoticism rather than authentic Arabic music. For example, the <strong>augmented second interval</strong> 
                is not specific to Arab culture but is a generalized Western signifier for foreignness. Such aural shorthands expose 
                a crucial power dynamic where <strong>European fantasies, not Arab people, define Middle Eastern identity in the 
                film</strong>. More fundamentally, Disney treats Arab music culture as a repository of exotic sounds rather than a 
                living tradition with its own significance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, excluding Arab musicians underscores the exploitative approach of this era. The exclusion of Arab 
                musicians from the creative process demonstrates that this era relied on Western fantasies of the "Orient," not 
                engagement with actual Arab musical traditions.

            <h2>"A Whole New World": Western Musical Hegemony</h2>

            </div>

            <p>
                "A Whole New World," the film's romantic theme, abandons these exotic signifiers entirely for a standard 
                Broadway ballad structure. <strong>While the "Other" provides exotic flavor, Western musical hegemony persists 
                through the sonic theme of the film</strong>.
