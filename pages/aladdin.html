            <h2>Overview: Orientalism in Action</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Aladdin</em> (1992) deploys Orientalist musical tactics that define the Arab world as savage and inferior.

                <p>"Where they cut off your ear / If they don't like your face / It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."</p>
                <cite>— Original lyrics to "Arabian Nights" (later revised after criticism)</cite>
            </div>

            <p>
                The opening song, "Arabian Nights," initially described the Middle Eastern setting as a place of barbarism and violence. 
                While protests forced a lyrical revision, the retained line, "It's barbaric, but hey, it's home," signaled the film's 
                ideological stance (King et al.). The lyrics frame the setting through a "white gaze," geographically and morally positioning 
                American culture as superior to the depicted "Other."

            <h2>Musical Orientalism: "Aural Shorthand"</h2>
            
            <p>
                Musically, composers Alan Menken and Howard Ashman utilized <strong>"aural shorthands"</strong> — recognizable 
                markers of exoticism rather than authentic Arabic music. For example, the <strong>augmented second interval</strong> 
                is not specific to Arab culture but is a generalized Western signifier for foreignness. Such aural shorthands expose 
                a crucial power dynamic where <strong>European fantasies, not Arab people, define Middle Eastern identity in the 
                film</strong>. More fundamentally, Disney treats Arab music culture as a repository of exotic sounds rather than a 
                living tradition with its own significance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, the creative process excludes Arab musicians, failing to engage with actual Arab musical traditions.

            <h2>"A Whole New World": Western Musical Hegemony</h2>
            
            <div class="video-container">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xYjFxFFdyyk" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                "A Whole New World," the film's romantic theme, abandons these exotic signifiers entirely for a standard 
                Broadway ballad structure, and the lyrics ironically suggest how there's a better "world" devoid of the inferior "Other" (Baber and Spickard). <strong>While the "Other" provides exotic flavor, Western musical hegemony persists 
                through the sonic theme of the film</strong>.
