                        <p><strong>Key Problem:</strong> Music explicitly reinforced racist discourse, with derogatory terms and stereotypes presented as entertainment. This established a precedent for reducing non-Western cultures to easily consumable tropes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Key Issue:</strong> Genocide is reframed as environmental conflict—a universal problem that doesn't confront Western society. The "blue corn moon" was invented for sonic appeal despite being geographically inaccurate.</p>

                        <p>Frozen's superficial use of generalized Scandinavian motifs drew criticism for cultural insensitivity. The film used a generic "frozen north" aesthetic without meaningful engagement with Sámi culture, despite the region's Indigenous people.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This criticism led Disney to implement a formalized collaborative model for its sequel, marking a shift in corporate strategy toward "managed inclusion."</p>

                        <p>While Disney's methods evolved from crude stereotyping to formalized collaboration, <strong>the underlying logic of cultural hegemony remains intact</strong>. The shift demonstrates the adaptability of power:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1950s:</strong> Overt racist caricature</li>
                            <li><strong>1990s:</strong> Orientalist "aural shorthand"</li>
                            <li><strong>2010s-2020s:</strong> Consultative appropriation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> Disney has reformed its methods without relinquishing structural control. The corporation invites "Others" into the room but has not handed over the baton. Western composers retain final authority, non-Western elements serve Western frameworks, and profits remain centralized.</p>
                        <p><strong>True decolonization requires redistribution of creative authority, not just better consultation.</strong></p>`
