                        <p>Aladdin deploys Orientalist musical tactics that define the Arab world as savage and inferior. "Arabian Nights" initially described the Middle East as barbaric, and even after protests, retained the line "It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Musical Strategy:</strong> Composers used "aural shorthand" - recognizable markers like the augmented second interval - rather than authentic Arabic music. Arab musicians were excluded entirely from the creative process.</p>

                        <p>Pocahontas represents a historical sanitization project, romanticizing violent colonial encounters. "Savages" equates Indigenous resistance with colonial violence, erasing power imbalances.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Issue:</strong> "Colors of the Wind" employs Western pop ballad structure to create a "safe" version of Indigeneity that appeals to Western romanticism while stripping away harsh reality. Indigenous philosophy is filtered through Western conventions.</p>

                        <p>Frozen's superficial use of generalized Scandinavian motifs drew criticism for cultural insensitivity. The film used a generic "frozen north" aesthetic without meaningful engagement with Sámi culture, despite the story's setting.</p>
                        <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This criticism led Disney to implement a formalized collaborative model for its sequel, marking a shift in corporate strategy toward "managed inclusion."</p>

                        <p>Disney partnered with the Oceanic Cultural Trust and composer Opetaia Foa'i. However, collaboration served primarily to extract cultural legitimacy while maintaining Western control.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Foa'i was asked to revise compositions for "English ears." Te Vaka's Polynesian contributions provide authenticity only when contained within recognizable American conventions - exemplifying "commodity racism."</p>

                        <p>Disney partnered with <em>verddet</em>, an advisory group of Sámi artists and elders. Visual representation improved significantly, but musical authority remained firmly Western.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Issue:</strong> The film substituted joik (traditional Sámi vocalization) with kulning (Scandinavian cattle call) for the central motif. Composer Christophe Beck dismissed joik as "Hey Na Na music," reflecting Eurocentric refusal to engage with Indigenous musical complexity.</p>

                        <p>While Disney's methods evolved from exclusion to collaboration, the underlying logic of cultural hegemony remains intact. The shift demonstrates the adaptability of power: in the 1990s, hegemony operated through crude stereotyping; today, it operates through managed inclusion.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Verdict:</strong> Disney has reformed its methods without relinquishing structural control. The corporation has adapted by inviting "Others" into the room, but it has not handed over the baton. Western composers retain final authority, non-Western elements serve Western frameworks, and profits remain centralized.</p>
                        <p><strong>True decolonization requires redistribution of creative authority, not just better consultation.</strong></p>`
