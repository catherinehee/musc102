```css
/* Increased line-height for academic reading comfort */
body: 18px base font, line-height 1.8-1.9
film-content p: 1.1rem font, line-height 1.9, text-align justify

/* Better heading hierarchy */
h2: margin-top 4rem (increased from 3rem)
h2:first-of-type: margin-top 0 (no awkward gap at top)
h3: margin-top 2.5rem (increased from 2rem)
```

**Spacing Consistency:**
```css
/* Video embeds */
margin: 2.5rem 0 (increased from 2rem)

/* Quote boxes */
padding: 2rem (increased from 1.5rem)
margin: 2.5rem 0 (increased from 2rem)
cite: font-size 0.95rem (increased from 0.9rem)

/* Key points boxes */
padding: 2.5rem (increased from 2rem)
