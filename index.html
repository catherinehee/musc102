                        The Walt Disney Company occupies a globally influential position within the landscape of cultural 
                        production. Its animated features, theme parks, and media conglomerates widely propagate its narratives, 
                        critically shaping worldviews of audiences. Today, Disney's works are globally consumed cultural artifacts 
                        that have been integral to entertainment for generations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disney is not only a storyteller, but also a <strong>commercial Western entity with market-driven 
                        imperatives</strong>. Walt Disney believed in the "terrific power of music," asserting that films would be 
                        "dragging and boring" without it; music imbues them with "life and vitality." Following this philosophy, 
                        Disney expertly leverages music to propel narratives and establish depicted identities. Yet, just as music 
                        communicates culture, music also transmits ideas and concepts. Thus, Disney's influences must be rigorously 
                        scrutinized, as the corporation prescribes ideologies beneficial to Western dominance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In recent film releases, Disney has noticeably incorporated more accurate depictions—Colombian representation 
                        in <em>Encanto</em>, Polynesian collaboration in <em>Moana</em>, Sámi consultation for <em>Frozen II</em>. 
                        However, critics question whether Disney's efforts genuinely constitute <strong>cultural appreciation or 
                        merely sophisticated forms of appropriation</strong>.

                        Although Disney has replaced the stereotyped music of its earlier films with collaborative 
                        compositions of its modern releases, <strong>this methodological shift masks a continuity in power</strong>. 
                        Current inclusion strategies only serve to insulate the corporation from critique, allowing it to 
                        commodify cultural difference while maintaining strict Western control over the final product.

                        <strong>Central Question:</strong> Has Disney's evolution in representing non-Western cultures 
                        constituted genuine decolonization or merely sophisticated adaptation of cultural hegemony?

                        Through analysis of musical soundtracks, scholarly critiques, and interviews with involved musicians, 
                        this visual essay investigates how Disney's animated films' musical representation of non-Western cultures 
                        has evolved since the 1990s—and traces its roots back to the 1950s. It examines <strong>what drove these 
                        transformations and whether such changes represent meaningful progress</strong>. The evidence reveals a 
                        troubling pattern: when Polynesian composer Opetaia Foa'i is asked to revise his music for "English ears," 
                        when Christophe Beck dismisses Sámi joik as "Hey Na Na music," when <em>Encanto</em> simplifies Colombian 
                        bambuco for "broad appeal"—these aren't isolated incidents. They're systematic evidence that the 
                        methodological shift masks a continuity in power.

                <h2>Discussion: From Orientalism to Consultative Appropriation</h2>
                <div class="discussion-content">
                    <p>
                        The comparative analysis demonstrates that while Disney's methods have evolved from exclusion to 
                        consultation, <strong>fundamental mechanisms of cultural power remain structurally intact</strong>. 
                        Phase I exemplified Said's Orientalism—Arab and Indigenous cultures constructed as exotic Others 
                        through stereotypical musical signifiers and complete exclusion from creative processes. The augmented 
                        second interval in <em>Aladdin</em> and the fabricated "blue corn moon" in <em>Pocahontas</em> represented 
                        extraction without consultation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Phase II evolved rather than eliminated Orientalist logic. Disney now incorporates non-Western creators 
                        <strong>on terms that preserve Western authority</strong>. When Foa'i revises lyrics for "English ears" 
                        or Beck dismisses joik as "Hey Na Na music," collaboration occurs without power redistribution. The 
                        corporation transitioned from blatant Orientalism to sophisticated commodity racism: ethnic identity 
                        provides marketable "spice" while Western conventions structure the final product.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Economic Imperative: Why Structural Change Remains Constrained</h3>
                    <p>
                        The culture industry framework reveals why structural change remains impossible under current conditions. 
                        Disney executives assume—reinforced by decades of market data—that Western musical conventions constitute 
                        "universal" emotional language ensuring profitability, while non-Western structures represent financial risk. 
                        Economics explains the systematic "wrapping" pattern in <em>Moana</em> and the substitution of kulning for 
                        joik in <em>Frozen II</em>. These are <strong>calculated commercial decisions prioritizing marketability over 
                        cultural integrity</strong>. Collaboration itself becomes marketable, allowing Disney to profit from appearing 
                        culturally responsible while maintaining extractive practices.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Destroying Music Cultures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through musical appropriation, Disney dismantles entire music cultures by severing sounds from the social 
                        organizations and cultural contexts that give them meaning. When Disney's production process isolates sonic 
                        elements to use as aural shorthands, it destroys the music culture: the social relations of performance, 
                        material culture, and ideas about music are all subordinated to Western superculture. The advisory process 
                        functions extractively—consultants provide cultural data that Western decision-makers recontextualize for 
                        commercial consumption, while source communities lose control over how their music cultures are represented globally.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What audiences learn from such films is a Western superculture's version of these music cultures: non-Western 
                        musical traditions provide exotic enrichment to Western narratives, require Western framing to achieve emotional 
                        legitimacy, and see their own interpretations rendered irrelevant.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Weighing Progress Against Persistent Limitations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fair interpretation requires acknowledging procedural improvements. Phase II consultants gained unprecedented 
                        platform and creative input. Indigenous artists like Foa'i and Fjellheim achieved global visibility, reaching 
                        hundreds of millions. Young Polynesian and Sámi viewers encounter characters who speak their languages—representation 
                        holding psychological value absent from earlier complete erasure. Reception among source communities varies: some 
                        celebrate any visibility while others critique persistent power imbalances.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yet <strong>acknowledging advances must not preclude structural critique</strong>. The improvements demonstrate 
                        evolution within hegemonic systems, not liberation from them. Disney progressed from complete exclusion to limited 
                        inclusion, from denying consultation to marketing it. These are meaningful steps that nonetheless preserve Western 
                        dominance. Gramsci's hegemonic adaptation explains the shift: rather than rejecting critique about racist representation, 
                        Disney absorbed it by inviting consultants into the process while retaining final creative command. The system appears 
                        more ethical because of its inclusion of diverse voices, yet the fundamental architecture of decision-making remains 
                        unchanged.

                <div class="conclusion-box">
                    <p>
                        Disney's evolution in representing non-Western cultures constitutes <strong>sophisticated hegemonic adaptation, 
                        not genuine decolonization</strong>. The corporation reformed methods without relinquishing structural power. The 
                        trajectory demonstrates Gramsci's theory: dominant systems absorb critique to maintain power rather than redistribute 
                        it. In the 1990s, the mechanism was Orientalist exclusion and crude stereotyping. Today, consultative appropriation 
                        invites "Others" into the room without handing over creative authority.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Visible improvements in recent film scores from <em>Moana</em> and <em>Frozen II</em> should not obscure persistent 
                        reality: <strong>Western composers retain final authority and non-Western elements accessorize Western frameworks</strong>. 
                        When executives tell Polynesian composers to revise for "English ears," when they substitute Scandinavian kulning for 
                        Sámi joik, when they simplify Colombian bambuco for "broad appeal"—these decisions reveal the persistent logic of the 
                        culture industry. Economic imperatives position Western musical conventions as "universal" while treating non-Western 
                        structures as financial risk.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Broader Significance</h3>

                        The significance extends beyond Disney. <strong>These patterns shape how billions encounter cultural differences during 
                        childhood's formative stages</strong>, conditioning audiences to perceive Western musical conventions as emotionally 
                        sophisticated and universal while non-Western traditions appear as exotic enrichment. For children from represented 
                        cultures, the films teach that their musical heritage requires Western framing to achieve validity—cultural hegemony's 
                        ultimate function.

                        True decolonization requires redistributing creative authority. Until Indigenous and non-Western creators hold power 
                        to define their own sonic narratives by structuring films around their musical traditions rather than Western conventions, 
                        Disney's music will remain a sophisticated instrument of Western hegemony disguised as respect. The corporation has 
                        reformed its methods without relinquishing structural control. <strong>The song may sound more inclusive, but the 
                        conductors remain unchanged.</strong>
