                        The Walt Disney Company occupies a globally influential position within the landscape of cultural 
                        production. Its animated features, theme parks, and media conglomerates widely propagate its narratives, 
                        critically shaping worldviews of audiences. Today, Disney's works are globally consumed cultural artifacts 
                        that have been integral to entertainment for generations.

                    <p>
                        Disney is not only a storyteller, but also a <strong>commercial Western entity with market-driven 
                        imperatives</strong>.  Walt Disney believed in the "terrific power of music," asserting that films would be "dragging and boring" without it; music imbues them with "life and vitality" (Tietyen, 13-14). 
                        Following this philosophy, Disney expertly leverages music to propel narratives and establish depicted identities.
                         Yet, just as music communicates culture, music also transmits ideas and concepts. 
                         Thus, Disney’s influences must be rigorously scrutinized, as the corporation prescribes ideologies beneficial to Western dominance. 

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In recent film releases, Disney has noticeably incorporated more accurate depictions. 
                        However, critics question whether Disney's efforts genuinely constitute <strong>cultural appreciation or 
                        merely sophisticated forms of appropriation</strong>.

                        Current inclusion strategies only serve to insulate the corporation from critique, allowing it to 
                        commodify cultural difference while maintaining strict Western control over the final product.

                <h2>Discussion: From Orientalism to Consultative Appropriation</h2>
                
                <div class="discussion-content">
                    <p>
                        The comparative analysis demonstrates that while Disney's methods have evolved from exclusion to consultation, fundamental mechanisms of cultural power remain structurally intact. 
                        Phase I exemplified Said's Orientalism, specifically Arab and Indigenous cultures constructed as exotic Others through stereotypical musical signifiers and complete exclusion from creative processes. Phase II evolved rather than eliminated Orientalist logic. Disney now incorporates non-Western creators on terms that preserve Western authority. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Gramsci's hegemonic adaptation explains the shift. Rather than rejecting critique about racist representation, Disney absorbed it by inviting consultants into the process while retaining final creative command. The system appears more ethical because of its inclusion of diverse voices, yet the fundamental architecture of decision-making remains unchanged. <strong>Consultation creates moral cover for continued appropriation.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Economic Imperative: Why Structural Change Remains Constrained</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>culture industry framework</strong> reveals why structural change remains impossible. Drawing from decades 
                        of market data, Disney executives assume that Western musical conventions convey an 
                        "universal" emotional language that ensures profitability, 
                        while non-Western structures represent financial risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disney's musical choices directly reflect the culture industry's standardization imperative. Systematic "wrapping" in <em></em>Moana</em> and substituting <em>kulning</em> for <em>joik</em> in <em>Frozen II</em> are calculated commercial decisions prioritizing marketability over cultural integrity. Non-Western musical structures alone cannot drive narratives because doing so would violate the industry's standardization formulae. Instead, the industry jams non-Western elements into Western frameworks to guarantee success. 


                    </p>

                    <p>Recently, the culture industry seems to have commodified the consultative process itself. Displays of collaboration offer marketable appeal, allowing Disney to profit from appearing culturally responsible while maintaining extractive practices. <strong>The pattern illustrates the culture industry's capacity to adapt to critique: what appears as ethical progress becomes another product feature enhancing commercial appeal.</strong> Moreover, under hooks’ commodity racism, diversity also sells because it offers marketable difference without disrupting the Western foundation. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Destroying Music Cultures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through musical appropriation, Disney dismantles entire music cultures by severing sounds from the social 
                        organizations and cultural contexts that give them meaning. When Disney's production process isolates sonic 
                        elements to use as aural shorthands, it destroys the music culture: the social relations of performance, 
                        material culture, and ideas about music are all subordinated to Western superculture. The advisory process 
                        functions extractively—consultants provide cultural data that Western decision-makers recontextualize for 
                        commercial consumption, while source communities lose control over how their music cultures are represented globally.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What audiences learn from such films is a Western superculture's version of these music cultures: non-Western 
                        musical traditions provide exotic enrichment to Western narratives, require Western framing to achieve emotional 
                        legitimacy, and see their own interpretations rendered irrelevant.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Weighing Progress Against Persistent Limitations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Disney’s procedural improvements are still wins. Phase II consultants gained an unprecedented platform
                         and more creative input. Indigenous artists like <strong>Foa'i</strong> and <strong>Fjellheim</strong> achieved global visibility, reaching hundreds 
                         of millions. Young Polynesian and Sámi viewers encounter characters who speak their languages and 
                         wear their clothes and sing their songs (Arctic Council, 2020). 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Reception among source communities also varies. Some celebrate any visibility while others 
                        critique persistent power imbalances (Artic Record, 2020). Structural critique doesn't negate the value some community 
                        members find in Disney's evolving representations. Yet, <strong>the improvements demonstrate evolution 
                        within hegemonic systems, not liberation from them</strong>. While these are meaningful steps, they 
                        nonetheless preserve Western dominance.

                <h2>Conclusion: Sophisticated Hegemony, Not Decolonization</h2>
                <div class="conclusion-box">
                    <p>
                        Disney's evolution in representing non-Western cultures constitutes <strong>sophisticated hegemonic adaptation, 
                        not genuine decolonization</strong>. The corporation reformed methods without relinquishing structural power. The 
                        trajectory demonstrates Gramsci's theory: dominant systems absorb critique to maintain power rather than redistribute 
                        it. In the 1990s, the mechanism was Orientalist exclusion and crude stereotyping. Today, consultative appropriation 
                        invites "Others" into the room without handing over creative authority.

                    <p>
                        Visible improvements in recent film scores from <em>Moana</em> and <em>Frozen II</em> should not obscure persistent 
                        reality: <strong>Western composers retain final authority and non-Western elements accessorize Western frameworks</strong>. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Broader Significance</h3>
                    <p>
                        The significance extends beyond Disney. <strong>These patterns shape how billions encounter cultural differences during 
                        childhood's formative stages</strong>, conditioning audiences to perceive Western musical conventions as emotionally 
                        sophisticated and universal while non-Western traditions appear as exotic enrichment. For children from represented 
                        cultures, the films teach that their musical heritage seems to require Western framing to achieve validity.
                    </p>

                    <p class="call-to-action">
                        True decolonization requires redistributing creative authority. Until Indigenous and non-Western creators hold power 
                        to define their own sonic narratives by structuring films around their musical traditions rather than Western conventions, 
                        <strong>Disney's music will remain a sophisticated instrument of Western hegemony disguised as respect</strong>.
