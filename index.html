                        The Walt Disney Company occupies a globally influential position within the landscape of cultural 
                        production. Its animated features critically shape worldviews of audiences worldwide, particularly 
                        children, serving as primary sites of cultural education. Walt Disney believed in the "terrific 
                        power of music," asserting that films would be "dragging and boring" without it—music imbues them 
                        with "life and vitality." Yet just as music communicates culture, it also transmits ideology.

                    <p>
                        In recent years, Disney has been lauded for improved cultural depictions—Colombian representation in 
                        <em>Encanto</em>, Polynesian collaboration in <em>Moana</em>, Sámi consultation for <em>Frozen II</em>. 
                        These visible changes prompt a critical question: Do they represent genuine progress toward decolonizing 
                        cultural representation, or merely sophisticated adaptation of colonial methods?

                        Although Disney has replaced the stereotyped music of its earlier films with collaborative 
                        compositions of its modern releases, <strong>this methodological shift masks a continuity in power</strong>. 
                        Current inclusion strategies only serve to insulate the corporation from critique, allowing it to 
                        commodify cultural difference while maintaining strict Western control over the final product.

                        <strong>Central Question:</strong> Has Disney's evolution in representing non-Western cultures 
                        constituted genuine decolonization or merely sophisticated adaptation of cultural hegemony?

                        Through analysis of musical soundtracks, scholarly critiques, and interviews with involved musicians, 
                        this visual essay investigates how Disney's musical representation has evolved across <strong>seven 
                        decades</strong>—from the overt racist caricature of <em>Peter Pan</em> (1953) through the Orientalist 
                        stereotyping of the 1990s to the consultative appropriation of contemporary releases. The evidence 
                        reveals a troubling pattern: when Polynesian composer Opetaia Foa'i is asked to revise his music for 
                        "English ears," when Christophe Beck dismisses Sámi joik as "Hey Na Na music," when <em>Encanto</em> 
                        simplifies Colombian bambuco for "broad appeal"—these aren't isolated incidents. They're systematic 
                        evidence of persistent structural dynamics.

                <p class="section-intro">
                    This study categorizes Disney's evolution into distinct periods based on their approach to cultural 
                    representation. What emerges is a pattern of adaptation: as each methodology faces critique, Disney 
                    evolves its methods while preserving structural control. The corporation invites "Others" into the 
                    room—but has not handed over the baton.

                <h2>The Verdict: Hegemony Disguised as Diversity</h2>
                <div class="conclusion-box">
                    <p>
                        The pattern across seven decades is clear: <strong>hegemonic power adapts rather than relinquishes control</strong>. 
                        In the 1950s, Disney deployed overt racist caricature; in the 1990s, Orientalist "aural shorthand"; 
                        today, consultative appropriation. Each era's methodology responds to contemporary critique while 
                        preserving the fundamental dynamic—Western creators defining how non-Western cultures sound.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When executives tell Polynesian composers to revise for "English ears," when they substitute 
                        Scandinavian kulning for Sámi joik, when they simplify Colombian bambuco for "broad appeal"—these 
                        decisions reveal the persistent logic of the culture industry. Economic imperatives position Western 
                        musical conventions as "universal" while treating non-Western structures as financial risk. This 
                        assumption is never tested; instead, it functions as self-fulfilling prophecy, teaching global 
                        audiences to accept Western aesthetics as natural and Indigenous traditions as exotic.
                    </p>
                    <p class="call-to-action">
                        True decolonization requires more than better consultation—it requires <strong>redistribution of 
                        creative authority</strong>. Until Indigenous and non-Western creators hold the power to define their 
                        own sonic narratives, to structure emotional climax with their own musical traditions, to reject 
                        simplification in favor of complexity, Disney's music will remain a sophisticated instrument of 
                        Western hegemony disguised as respect. The corporation has reformed its methods without relinquishing 
                        structural control. The song may sound more inclusive, but the conductors remain unchanged.
